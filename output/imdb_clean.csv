I've always liked the con men / grifter genre because it's all about the glorious world of deceit, where nothing is as it seems. Typically the drama comes when the best laid plan falls apart, which it does so gloriously and tragically here. I'm looking forward to the black and white version, as there's a glorious luminosity to that format, and this picture really doesn't require color."

Let's start with the technical aspects. It is shot very well, the production design is so good that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't, the acting is phenomenal (especially from Joon Ho favorite Kang-Ho Song), and the score is the best of the year so far. And now for the story. Just wow. The script tackles so many complicated themes about society and class flawlessly, and it developes all of the characters perfectly. There are about 8 main characters, and they all feel like actual people and not objects for the story. The situation that the characters get in is very interesting and thrilling. This is the best film of the year, and one of the best ever. Just watch it."

Something that we missed out during MAMI. What a brilliant gripping tale this is! It is a class-conscious thriller that you wouldn't want to miss. To start with, it makes you laugh with its comic rendering. When you see the entire movie it defies all your expectations along the line. Bong Joon-ho crafts an intricate look at modern-day social hierarchies. He keeps you flipped on one mood then drastically changes it to the other while delivering some brilliant thematic elements. When you spend 132 minutes seeing this movie you encounter and experience: clever, humorous, dramatic and every other kind of emotion. It is also a hilarious and irreverent take on South Korea's class warfare. I cannot overstate how refreshing Parasite is both as a genius piece of arthouse cinema, but also a very contemporary comedy of errors. Parasite is so sublime because it can be watched for pure entertainment value of a sly poor family manipulating gullible elites into paying them for various services, but Parasite also wades in deep waters of sympathy for its poor desperate souls. It is an outstanding South Korean dark comedy that will stand up to the ages. Its final moments are so unsettling, and so unforgettable and impossible to estimate. It is a test that you undergo yourself and you're most likely to fail! 😊"

The usage of the home as a symbol emphasizes this theme, with the basement symbolizing the poor family's poverty and the upstairs signifying the affluent family's money and privilege. The film also focuses on the concept of the ""parasitic single,"" which refers to adult children who live with their parents and are unable to leave owing to a lack of work and financial security. It also depicts the influence of capitalism on individuals and how difficult it is to break out from the cycle of poverty. The film also emphasizes the topic of survival, as the impoverished family would go to any length to live, even if it means misleading and manipulating the wealthier family. It's crucial to remember that this film is a social commentary and a mirror of present society's reality; it may be uncomfortable to see, but it's necessary to comprehend the message it's attempting to portray. Bong Joon-ho directed the 2019 South Korean black comedy thriller film Parasite. The narrative follows the Kim family, an impoverished family of four living in a tiny semi-basement apartment. When the son, Ki-woo, is given the opportunity to teach the Park's daughter, they become entangled in the life of the rich Park family. As Ki-woo gets increasingly involved in the Parks' life, the rest of the Kim family begins to enter the Parks' lives in various ways, with each member taking on a position as a tutor or employee. The film tackles issues of class struggle and social inequity, as the Kim family's actions set in motion a chain of events that reveal the two families' underlying tensions and secrets. The film also deals with themes of greed and the consequences of actions. The performances of the ensemble, and the film's unusual combination of genres. It was the first South Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It also won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay, becoming Bong Joon-ho the first Asian director to win Best Director at the Oscars. The film received widespread praise for its superb acting, director, storyline, and depiction of societal concerns and class conflict. It was also a box office triumph in South Korea and internationally. When Parasite was released, it gained critical praise, with many applauding Bong Joon-directing."

What does the designation tell us about this extraordinary movie to call it ""foreign""? Foreign to whom and in what way? Yep, I get it, not made in America (Hollywood) and not in English. That designation means nothing used for a movie of such universal themes so easily accessible to the viewer. The director has observed the Kurosawa principle about balancing all the elements of the film's language, in addition to keeping to his own approach of keeping the narrative and dramatic aspects simple. Even with subtitles I was laughing out loud at the humorous bits. Can western movies claim that when they're subtitled in other languages? This sublime simplicity results in a movie so finely calibrated that it wipes out in one fell swoop the tiresome arthouse talking head cinematic tradition of the west. The South Korean film isn't ""foreign"", it's smack in the middle of a filmmaking tradition that respects the story, the viewer and the very medium of film. Think Kurosawa, again. How sublime in their simplicity are his movies? Critics carry in about what genre it is? What political and sociological commentary the director is trying out. None of that matters when a movie is so tonally pitch perfect. The ""change"" of pace about half way through is so seamless, one gasps long after the last frame that it couldn't possibly have gone any other way. It's the power of the impeccable story telling via the medium of film that elevates this movie above the fray. Editing, acting, cinematography are all pitch perfect. Hollywood, go cry in your pretzels, with your endless commercial blockbusters and franchises. The centre of gravity has shifted and you are now the ""foreigner"" while the South Korean holds court in the center of the global cinematic universe. Thank you for giving it the ""best"" picture award full stop. It is one of the greatest films of all time in its tone, seamlessness, simplicity, and both the humour and tragedy of the human story it depicts. A great, great, great cinematic experience. Ten stars barely begins to convey the greatness."

Simplicity without a doubt is the ultimate sophistication. I feel Parasite was an infastation to Western cinematography, taking all tip awards and leaving nothing behind. Eastern cinema has a lot more to offer than cheesy martial arts and special effects, and Parasite is the gateway towards this level of cinematic appreciation. This movie portrays a lower-class family, making ends meet and struggling to survive in a capitally oriented world, by skipping into the higher layer of society. Although they have less to show, they are more of a family than their higher-class counterpart, living the life of riches without ever fully experiencing any of it together. In a way, it blends and clearly separates these two worlds, similair in essence but completely different in reality. It is a manifesto on class struggles and how social stratification represents an unpenetrable rock wall, where a lifetime is not enough to break free and move to a higher layer. Because of this, you are forced to become a parasite and take from others to grow, or remain a parasite of society and depend on the generousity of the Rich. In the end, one has to wonder if Capital is a true parasite of our lives, taking our focus from the importance of the human experience and manipulating our life's purpose as it pleases?"

The whole 2nd half had my jaw on the floor and gripping my seat, while the 1st half had my laughing every few lines. This movie is well worth the watch, and entirely lived up to the hype"

I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10. Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is. I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways. What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013). And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them. I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell). Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others. When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."

This guy is like a total GOD of movies, a guru in it's true sense. For those of you which seen other movies of this guy, you will know immediately what I mean. His movies are unique. You can't compare them with something else. And Parasite is just one of them which has no equal. The title is self explanatory. You can't name this movie otherwise once you see it.

When you see the best analysis channels like Nerdwriter write glowing essays on Parasite you know its hit its mark very deeply. Outward differences aside, this movie IMO is very similar to the ""What Could Go Wrong?"" Genre like in No Country for Old Men, A Simple Plan, but its also such a study and understanding in different socio-economic class, poor vs rich, and its fourth act is very Hitchcock..

Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade, hell I'd go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's intense. It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused, which is something that many films fail to do. The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic, with no good guys or bad guys: They're people. They feel like real and believable characters, which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year. It's well shot, as to be expected, and the social commentary is fantastic. This is the first movie I've seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect, I loved every single bit of it."

Its an absolute masterpiece of genre subtlety that had me engrossed from the very beginning. It had already been out quite some time before I got to watching it because, I just wasn't drawn to it in any way. It came across as boring to me whilst reading the studio advertisement blurb. Luckily on one of those rainy day moments, not knowing what I fancied watching, I finally opted to watch it; and so pleased I did. Its a simple story of the existing life of poverty in South Korea (many people are destitute but the government hides it) and, a simple piece of luck that spiraled out of control into a full blown scam. The main 4 antagonists of the story are a deadbeat father, a miserable grumpy mother, a selfish foul mouthed daughter with the in your face attitude that kids have today and finally, a son who is the only decent person in the family and wants to better himself and his lifestyle. The way the individual actors portray their character roles is of extremely Oscar worthy performances. Everything is carried out in such a calm, peaceful and laid back manner; except for a bit of mayhem, at a garden party, at the closing stages of the film. Bad Language: YES...and not really necessary for the film... Sex: NO...but some totally unneeded intimate lewd groping scenes... Not a Family film but a superb one for the 16 and over viewers!"

Parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art. It's very easily digestible by the masses, as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even Marvel-DC-audiences can enjoy. However this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors. They're subtle enough though, that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect. Those who seek an important and complex message can find it, and those who seek a 2-hour entertainment can also find it. Therefore we have the ""good, but overrated"" phenomenon. I've just recently been introduced to the S.Korean film industry. After a long break from contemporary Hollywood movies, my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to S.Korean films. I firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big Hollywood blockbusters and what I've experienced with Korean cinema so far. Just for reference, the Korean movies I've seen so far are basically crime/drama/mystery movies with my top 3 being: 1. Parasite, 2. the Chaser, 3. Memories of murder. But there are many that I've yet to watch. What all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be a)real enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world, b)funny with respect to the story and the characters, and c) weirdly they felt like they weren't trying too much. I don't know if it's just me being sick of all the Hollywood's ""trying to be super cool"" act, but I find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously, but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics. And I find that very hard to do, it really is a thin line. I am so excited to have discovered S.Korean cinema, and i wish more people would not be afraid of the non-Hollywood film industry, as I was. So, regarding Parasite. If you haven't seen the movie yet, and considering watching it, GO WATCH IT! Don't read anything else. Don't research and ideally don't even watch the trailer. This movie stuck with me for days after watching it. I wish I could forget what I watched and watch it again with a clean slate. What an experience it was! My spoiler-free thoughts: This movie is a master-class in film making and cinematography. All the symbolism and the brilliant shots were so subtle, nothing was thrown in your face."

The first film I've watched with him was ""A Taxi Driver"" (2017), another awesome filme about some events of the Gwangju Uprising in 1980.

It is funny social satire, an engaging thriller and heart breaking drama (esp. the last shot of the film) rolled into a story that feels to go everywhere it needs to. I have watched this twice and it is such a engaging story first and foremost. That it also functions as a rebuke of capital makes the film richer but the social themes don't overwhelm it as pure storytelling. The film has a great vertical aspect to its visual constructions. It has a lot of stairs in the film and the camera is moving up and down a lot during it. It is not overdone but the use of space is really striking. So glad I blind bought this."

It's narrative had a global relevance seldom seen in cinema these days. It's multi-layered social commentary that still managed to be very Korean all with its profusely embedded cultural and historical references scattered throughout the story which seemingly etched in stone that was gifted to one of the main characters. Metaphorical, literal, it's everything a brilliant story could ever be. Never had I laughed in a cineplex so loud it's almost scandalous, an orgasmic feeling even. But what stands out as phenomenal in this film is the richness of how the characters in the film were all fleshed out, result is very multi-dimensional. I've seen qute a few of Bong Joon-ho's film works, and I can already say this film is not his finest work but it's grasp over the numerous accolades it has received since its release is very much deserved, and I definitely still want to be surprised with the stories he has already told and are still gonna tell in the future, so I'm very much looking forward to exploring his other works as well, it's just like finding jewel in the rough as they say.

It has been difficult, almost impossible to put down into words anything about it. I truly lacked the right words and was even afraid not to be true to its core. Here's a film which leaves no one indifferent. It is certainly metaphorical in every aspect: the water that is both a blessing or a catatrophe depending on which side of the social pyramid one stands; the smell inpregnated in old people's clothes which both disgusts and arouses the rich couple; the large window in their house in comparison to the poor family 's basement window. The question starts with a simple title:""Parasite"". Who are they? The ones in the basement, at the bottom of the pyramid? The ones in the middle trying to strive, even if they cannot get rid of the smell? The ones on top of that pyramid who pretend to accept others yet lack total RESPECT? Or aren't WE all parasites somehow and loose perspective so often? Wasn't a camera leading our eyes all the time? For the first time in my life I had a feeling of real movement while watching a film. Sometimes I was moving left, right, up or down. Sometimes I was watching. Others I was being watched. The window could be either a screen to the outside world, inside the house.

It is difficult to judge the acting when you don't speak the language, but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world, yet so similar to ours.

Still, it exceeded my expectations. It's a comedy, Drama, Thriller and Horror film in one. Sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast, but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained. I think Parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public. The cinematography and mise-en-scene are beautiful as it often is in Korean films; the style is very similar to Burning by Lee Chang-Dong. But the story is something else. During the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh, but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thriller/horror. I'm not going to say more about the plot/story than that because i don't want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything. This film is simply a must watch!! No wonder it won the Palme d'Or."

I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone. Parasite is nothing short of genius. It's best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible. This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent. Bong Joon-Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible. The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety. Bong Joon-Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch. Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience. The events that unfold don't come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing. Aside from the story, this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019. The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous. There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic. The editing is fantastic as the film's pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever. The aesthetics on the whole is top notch. I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles. I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any. Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense. Whilst delivering a fun film, there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon-Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend. I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they're dumb. 2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt. A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven't then go watch it immediately. This is a film you should not miss."

This twisty long con of a film finds a down on their luck family (downtrodden due to their own circumstances or the current economic paradigm in South Korea?) who thanks to a friend of the college aged son gets an opportunity to get a job as tutor for a rich family (the daughter's grades aren't up to snuff, at least according to the overprotective mother) but once he gets his foot in the door he finds he can bring the rest of his disparate clan (his mom, dad & sister) into the mix. His sister comes in as an artistic coach to the well-off youngest son & elaborate schemes are perpetrated to oust the driver & the maid (who worked at the property w/the architect of the manse) so that his parents can fill in those slots. So far so good (depending on whose side you happen to be on since the elite clan is depicted is out of touch & inheritors of the new Korea) but then a genius twist happens which throws the entire plot upside down, forcing our anti-heroes to make a decision which will effect their world. Wonderfully delineated as a lighthearted (at least for the most part) 'me against them' (there's a wonderful sequence where the working family rushes home in the rain & their journey home is literally a descent into hell) which rides the fine line between cruel & mirthful. One of the year's best, catch it!"

It's a ''cult movie'' with subtle meanings behind the obvious, when I finished I didn't understand all the things in the movie. But after a moment of reflection and see reviews and comments on Youtube, I realize the depth in history, how the social injustices were represented, and why the title is ''parasite''. There's no villain, there aren't the simplistic division between ''bad'' and ''good'' guys, all the people had at least a little bit of parasitism..."

Memories of Murder, Mother, and the Host are fantastic, Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good. He's never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice, I can say he's still going strong. Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it (Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender.) The madman went as far as I say, to making the second best movie of the year, only behind the Lighthouse for me. But for everyone else it's their number one and deservedly so. It's just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy, critic and casual viewer alike. The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen. Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there's that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece; changing the atmosphere, themes, and style in a way that makes 100% sense. It's like many movies in one. This will be talked about as being a classic of the decade for these reasons because of how perfectly it was done. Without spoiling too much, this movie is about class. And not in the obnoxious in-your-face way where the poorer characters can do no wrong and there's an obvious message of ""rich bad, poor sad"" but done in the way by subverting those tropes by making the poor flawed but smart and the rich into gullible people. Themes and messages the movie has are very subtle to being said out loud: that being mostly about exploring the ""line"" between class. Whether that be through extremely great writing or literally through the directing and how it's shot. The whole film is like this where a line in the shot separates the two classes. It's done through lines in the wall, one genius moment of a reflection on a window as it's being looked out of, a fridge, or just as simple as panning down like in the beginning to show they're the lowest of the low in a already low shot. How they view the same things such as rain tells a whole lot too. While the rich enjoy its beauty and smell, the poor despise it because it floods the neighborhood and house in a very tense dramatic scene. Another nice touch is where they're located: the poorer family living at the bottom of the hill get the brute end of the storm while the rich on top are unaffected."

Parasite is as brilliant as I've been told. One of 2019's best.,2020-02-16,imdb,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :) Yes, I know. I'm late as hell. I don't really have anything to offer you besides my personal opinion. Theses and video essays are breaking down Parasite at such a deep level that I can't really write anything new. Nevertheless, I'll share my thoughts on it because it would be a massive miss from someone who considers himself as a film critic. I had this movie on my watchlist since last summer, but I kept delaying it, underestimating my time. So, no, I'm not just watching Parasite because it won Best Picture at the Oscars, I always planned on it. In addition to that, yes, I also love it like most people, and no, I'm not writing this because I'm ""following the pack"". Bong Joon Ho simply delivered one of 2019's best films, and it's definitely cracking a spot in my Top10. I really enjoyed what Bong did with Okja, and I'm a massive fan of Snowpiercer. Therefore, this isn't just another South Korean flick. It's directed and co-written by someone who has been proving himself for quite some time. Even though I still defend that Sam Mendes deserved to win Best Director for his work on 1917, I'm more than happy that a foreign movie finally won Best Picture, and what a film to do it! It can be described as a dark dramedy, but I think social satire is more adequate. The differences between the rich and the poor are beautifully shown on-screen exclusively through visuals. There's so little exposition, which is one of the reasons why Parasite has one of 2019's best screenplays. The balance between explaining something and leaving it ambiguous is perfect. Throughout the runtime, Bong Joon Ho leans on an actor's face so that the audience can understand what that character is feeling through its expressions, which will explain its actions later on. There's a sequence that surely has been heavily discussed for the past months. It's raining, and Bong cleverly divides the screen with how the wealthy family is dealing with it against the poor neighborhood where the Kim family comes from. The gorgeous cinematography, the unforgettable musical score, the seamless editing... Everything about this sequence is technically flawless, and it carries such an emotionally powerful message. Something astonishing and beautiful to look at for some can be a horrible disaster for others. It's a movie that balances a lot of tones. In ten minutes, the tone goes from funny to dramatic to suspenseful to scary to absolute tragedy... and it all feels incredibly realistic."

The film's setup has a poor family, the Kims, infiltrating the lives of a wealthy family, the Parks, by becoming their new employees. Kim Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) is legitimately a tutor for the Parks' daughter Da-hye (Jung Ziso), but he uses his standing to then usher in his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park), who poses as an art tutor for the Parks' young son, Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung). The Kim kids then frame the Parks' driver for being a creep, which allows them to bring in their own father, Ki-taek (Kang-ho Sang), for the job. Finally, the family gets rid of the Parks' housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee), by making her seem sickly due to a peach allergy, which paves the way for the Kims' mother, Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang), to get the gig. The Parks don't learn that the Kims are related, and everything seems to be going fine until they learn that Moon-gwang has been hiding her husband, Geun-se (Myeong-hoon Park), in the Parks' basement. What makes the twist in ""Parasite"" so great is that it's as predictable as it is impossible to see coming. The basement in question is featured only twice in the film for less than a minute before its actual role is revealed. But it's a twist that doesn't feel out of question, as we've seen it happen already, just through the eyes of another family. What makes ""Parasite"" so perfect is that it understands the rules and power of storytelling. Everything on screen has a specific purpose and a meaning that transforms the story as it unpacks. And it's ironic that, as brilliant as Bong's plan for the story is, the genius of ""Parasite"" lies in the 10-minute sequence where an entire plan is demolished on sight."

The struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday. No matter the case, desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play. Parasite does away with telling a tale of class, greed and the values or family. Director Bong Joo-ho, who brought you The Host and Snowpiercer, creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting (if you watch you'll understand) that keeps Parasite from ever falling under. Even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing. Although it is considered a crime/comedy, I found Parasite to be a scary type of film. Think about it, manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it, no matter how witty and/or smart the victim is. The horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you. Getting to the ending, which I will discuss briefly without giving anything away, is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility. It's one of those endings that involve so much, but that much just happens to work so well in the film's favor. It's haunting, it's daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark. Verdict: Parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year. There's nothing to not like about this and it'll sure stay with you after the first viewing."

Whether that stance is on human struggles, political processes, or social conditioning, the stance prevails, and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us. Films like Elysium, Little Women, 1917, these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve. Parasite does it differently. The film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you, so that you don't have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it. You think you know who to root for, and who is the ""bad guy"". As you keep watching, Parasite continually pushes your sense of morals, prodding you with the question ""how far is too far?"" and ""how bad is too bad?"". These questions never give you a break, never give you time to come to terms with your answer as Bong Joon Ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in it's tracks. Parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care."

The film follows the family as they become involved in the lives of the wealthy Park family, ultimately leading to a series of unexpected and explosive events. One of the standout features of Parasite is its brilliant storytelling. Bong Joon-ho masterfully weaves together a complex and multi-layered narrative that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film is full of twists and turns, and just when you think you have it all figured out, something unexpected happens. The pacing is perfect, with just the right balance of tension and humor, and the characters are well-developed and believable. The acting in Parasite is top-notch, with standout performances from the entire cast. Song Kang-ho, who plays the head of the Kim family, is particularly impressive, conveying a wide range of emotions with subtlety and nuance. The cinematography is also excellent, with beautiful shots that perfectly capture the mood and tone of the film. Overall, Parasite is a masterful film that is not to be missed. It is a poignant commentary on social inequality and the human condition, and it is also a thrilling and entertaining ride. Highly recommended."

He deserved all the four Oscars that his film and he collected. There is something Tarantino-like about his style, in the way that he presents intersecting individuals from different social strata with apparently comic but definitely violent ultimate consequences. However, he is more polished than Tarantino was at the same age, and stage in his career. He presents reality without judging: the Kims are a family of jobless and largely useless individuals who do not even know how to fold pizza boxes properly, who have no money for Wi-Fi, and find it only in a toilet in the strangest place in a house that I've ever seen. The father - superbly played by Kang-ho Song - claims to have a plan but ultimately admits that the sole plan that won't fail is no plan. He tries to adapat to situations and is quick to react to any opportunity. The mother is admirably played by Hye-jin Jang, a courageous and resilient fighter in the face of life's adversities, and a fantastic imitator of North Korean leaders' speech delivery styles. Sun Kyun-Lee plays the son, a likeable young man who forges a university degree and copies a more successful friend's example, which will ultimately weigh him down like the rock that the friend gives him. His sister, the extremely beautiful So-dam Park, is the most level-headed and intelligent of the lot, a quick thinker who has a touch for children, The son finds a job as a teacher of English in a rich home run by a father who is often away on business in Paris, and a completely useless but physically gorgeous Yeo-jeong Jo (lovely legs!) By first pulling in his sister to placate and teach painting to the bolshy child in the rich family, and then finding jobs in the household for his father and mother, the son gets the family's foot in the door to a world of wealth such as they had never imagined, and which they rapidly start wishing they could occupy. Needless to say, that can only be achieved with violence, and violence does indeed beget violence, but there are surprises along the way. Acting is of the highest standard by all, but I would like to single out Jeong-eun Lee as the governess who is allergic to peaches, who keeps her husband hidden in the rich house's basement. The sequences where she rings the bell during the torrential rain, and where she tries to open the passage to the basement are unique and memorable."

""You've never seen a movie quite like X."" Such a statement has become overused to such a degree that it's impossible to be taken seriously, like how too many major new movies are gifted the m-word: masterpiece. So how do critics convey when a film truly is unexpectedly, brilliantly unpredictable in ways that feel revelatory? And what do we do when we see an actual ""masterpiece"" in this era of critics crying wolf? Especially one with so many twists and turns that the best writing about it will be long after spoiler warnings aren't needed? I'll do my best because Bong Joon-ho's ""Parasite"" is unquestionably one of the best films of the year. Just trust me on this one."

Absolutely exceptional acting, beautiful cinematography, moving symbolism and pertinent social commentary. I could never predict what would happen next in the plot, and just when you think it should go one way, it does a 180 and goes a completely unexpected direction. Go into it knowing as little as possible about it. It's so much better that way. You won't regret it."

While it does show the differences of the lives of the poor and the rich, it doesn't turn out how you would think. I walked into this movie thinking it would show how greedy rich people are, but boy was I wrong. This is really a unique survival movie, but not the type where a plane crashes or a man falls while cliff climbing. This is a survival movie of how our society can be evil instead of a particular group of people, and how hard it can be for the poor to survive in modern day society in some locations. I am not going to spoil it, but it really changes half way through with genius directing, cinematography, and music. 10/10 movie, believe the hype."

It tells the twisted, funny, and ultimately tragic tale of class discrimination and greed. About an dirt-poor Korean family that lives in cramped half basement level apartment where drunks regularly piss and throw-up outside their window. The out of work father Kim Ki-Taek, played terrifically by Song Kang Ho, helps his wife Chung Sook, well played by Jang Hye Jin, and his two children, son Ki-Woo and daughter Ki-Jeong, superbly played by Chi Woo Shik and Park So Dam, fold food boxes for a pitiful low-wage, but that all is about to change and a sinister plan is about to come into play, when Ki-Woo with the assistance of of his sister who creates a fraudulent diploma which helps him secure a job as an English tutor for the teenage daughter of the super wealthy Mr. Park and his naive wife, Yeon-kyo, marvelously played by Lee Sun Kyun and Cho Yeo Jeong. Miss Kim is so impressed by Ki-Woo's teaching skills that she mentions to him that her younger son needs a tutor to improve his art skills, so Ki-Woo recommends an art tutor which unbeknownst to her is his sister Ki-Jeong. What follows is the escalation of the Kim family's nefarious scam as they slowly make the Park family replace their household servants, beginning with their chauffeur, who is replaced by K-Woo's father, then they replace their live-in housekeeper, with Ki-Woo's mother. The Kims have now thoroughly invaded and occupied the Park's home without them suspecting anything, but this insidious situation will soon turn dangerous and deadly in a truly shocking climax. This amazing film is a slow burn in the beginning as the story unfolds but once the Kims are in the Park's home the film becomes an engrossing and breathtaking dark drama with some wicked humor. Masterful Oscar nominated direction by Bong Joon Ho who was first Korean filmmaker to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Gorgeous cinematography by Kyung-pyo Hong, and a captivating Oscar nominated Original Screenplay by Bong Joon Ho and Jin Won Han, impressive Oscar nominated Production Design by Ha-jun Lee and Won-Woo cho. A new classic that is nominated for 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture. In Korean with English subtitles."

While I recognise that nothing is perfect, the flaws in this movie are really hard to find. Every element of the movie is well thought out and detailed, and you can see that it was made by someone with great love and respect for this art. Direction, acting, editing, and screenplay are flawless, and the message comes through powerfully and well constructed.

How often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen, and begin writing your very own story? Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired. It's one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world. This film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner; it doesn't rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination, greed, family, and morality. Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film. Parasite tells the story of the Kim family, which is made of four individuals: a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl. This family takes interest in the Park family, who are incredibly rich and wealthy, when the teenage boy, played exceptionally by Choi Woo-shik, takes over his friend's job as an English tutor for the daughter of the Park family, who is a sophomore in high school. The film proceeds with the Kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the Park family, who are unaware of this. From there one, Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, tell a beautiful story of family, class discrimination, empathy, and morality in a satirical and dark manner. Parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling, which can leave one entertained, thrilled, and moved. Bong Joon-Ho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills, but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor. There are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls. The Park family are enamored by the sight and scenery of the rain from their window. Whereas the Kim family, struggle to grab their personal belongings due to their basement apartment being flooded by the rainfall. Yang Jin-mo's editing immerses the viewer in these visually engaging scenes. There is one moment where she uses the shot of the overflowing water transitioning to a bird-eye shot of the Kim family and their neighbors struggling to take the water out of their homes by using buckets."

Plenty of symbolic moments and a lot of unexpected twists to the storyline kept me on the edge of my seat practically yelling at the TV 'what is happening!?' whilst holding my head in my upturned hands. Parasite is basically a masterpiece. I was gripped instantly by the trailer and knew I had to watch it. I noticed a few goofs which incidentally others have too as they're written on here, luckily it doesn't detract from the storyline as there's no plot holes. I rarely enjoy a movie 100% but this one is definitely up there as a new favourite. Evoking a lot of different emotions throughout, well worth a watch."

The title alone has about 4 different meanings depending on your interpretation of the story. ""So metaphorical"" as a certain character says multiple times. Every single performance is brilliant, from Kang-ho Song, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and Hye-jin Jang as the Kims to Sun-kyun Lee and Yeo-jeung Jo as the parents of the Parks to everyone in between. In fact, there isn't a single area that the film falters in. Production design, editing, score, cinematography; they are all top class. The script by Bong Joon-ho and Jin Won Han is superb, covering a spectrum from dark comedy to social commentary. The direction by Bong is absolutely brilliant too. However, my absolute favourite thing about the film is the seamless tonal shifts. The film covers most genres that you could think of; from comedy and drama to thriller and even horror and it does all of this without feeling out of place for a second. Some of the tensest scenes I've seen in a film are contained here and they are utterly brilliant. No matter your interpretation, there's a clear message here, from an examination of money (or lack of) and beyond. The movie is spectacular and will undoubtedly go down as a classic."

It's a comedy, thriller, horror, and heist film rolled into one, meticulously directed and beautifully edited. It remains entertaining while dealing with heavy topics on the nature of class and wealth. While the movie takes some unexpected turns in tone, it never feels disjointed. Most importantly, Bong Joon-Ho has a way of relaying his social criticism in a nuanced manner, so that the theme of wealth disparity doesn't devolve simply into the poor vs. the wealthy narrative we see often in these types of dramas. Rather, he layers multiple shades of gray into the morality of characters, giving them humanity and therefore a stronger verisimilitude to real people in current society. It makes the movie's appeal universal. After watching the movie I was floored. It was the only thing I could think about for hours afterwards. Even now I keep discovering another layer of interpretation behind a dialogue or scene. And there is a lot to engage with when the film direction is so detailed. Each shot and each line of dialogue is a result of careful storyboarding and writing. Even the background details such as the brick walls and the litter by the Kims' basement are painstakingly styled and arranged by the set designers. And the result, at least in my summation, is a near perfect execution of a great film."

I was so happy when I saw it was playing in my local theatre, I rushed to go watch it with as little knowledge of the plot as possible, with the exception of the very vague trailer. And I'm glad the trailer I was shown was interesting enough to get my ass off to watch it but also vague enough to keep me at the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching it. This movie is simply amazing. You see this movie and you immediately feel and think ""masterpiece"". It is funny, dramatic, thrilling, scary, thought provoking, intriguing, depressing, it is everything one can expect from a movie. This premise kept taking many twists and turns I was never confused. The beginning was slow but I was never bored. The jokes land delightfully especially since it had to be translated from Korean. I couldn't believe a movie like this could actually exist until the last 20 minutes I was snapped back to reality and realized ""OH RIGHT THIS IS HAPPENING NOW"" I have nothing against movies in other languages and from other cultures but I honestly didn't think I was gonna be left this impressed. I feel terrible that I had been missing out on such phenomenal works of art. I will mostly definitely try to seek out more of this director's work. If this doesn't win Best Picture I will cry."

It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece. This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great. Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies. Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven. Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall. Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles. -TE (11.10.19)"

There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason.

If you are planning to watch this film, stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms. Now, directed by Joon-ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer, Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre. Its really hard to describe this film. I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests. But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice. That aside Joon-ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling. So much so that at first viewing you won't notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents. The name ""parasite"" is just one of them. At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are. Is it the rich, the poor, their expendable need for a better living or the house itself? Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors. The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang-ho Song. Writing is however what makes this film so great. You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything. There is not a single loop hole. Every character choices make sense, everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point. There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it. The social structure with the way we live, our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently, our priorities and what we value. Joon-Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened. He has completely turned a genre on its head. A film about social class has never been made like this before. Still, this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie. Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half. If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you. If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you. If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you."

This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling.

Parasite is a thought-provoking film that's part dark comedy, part family drama and part thriller. It's not really a singular genre film, but all these elements complement each other to deliver a surprisingly intense and shocking cinematic experience. Meet the Kim family, a down-on-their-luck, destitute family of four. Living in an impoverished basement in a South Korean slum, they are forced to glum off of other people's WiFi networks and take menial side jobs folding pizza boxes to bring in a pittance of money. The family's eldest son, Ki-woo (Choi), failed to make it into university, but what he lacks in book smarts, he makes up for in street smarts. He's a natural con artist with the gift of gab. An opportunity soon falls into Ki-woo's lap in the form of a job recommendation. His best friend, Min (Park Seo-joon), is traveling abroad and wants Ki-woo to take over tutoring one of his well-to-do teen students, Park Da-hye (Jung). Min-Hyuk has a romantic interest in the high-school sophomore Da-Hye and wants Ki-woo to watch over her and keep away potential suitors while he's abroad. Min-Hyuk's master plan is to start dating Da-hye when she enters university. Min-Hyuk's trust in a scam artist like Ki-woo is probably the biggest mistake of his life. With the help of his sister Ki-jung's (Park So-dam) exceptional forgery skills, Ki-woo is easily able to maneuver himself into the rich, well-to-do Park household as the new English tutor for Da-hye. Da-hye's mother, Mrs. Park (Jo Yeo-jeong), is a flighty, snooty simp. She makes for an easy mark for the Kim family to assert themselves into the lives of the Park homestead. After Ki-woo hatches a master plan, he's able to manipulate Ki-jung into the Park home as the art tutor for the Park's youngest child, Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). Next up, the kids trick the Park family patriarch, (Lee Sun-kyun), to fire his driver and hire their dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho). After that, it's the family housekeeper, Moon-gwang (Lee Jeong-eun), who gets ousted and replaced by the Kim kids' mother, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin). However, Ki-woo's carefully layered plan is nothing more than a house of cards, and a dark secret within the Park household threatens to shatter the Kim's ticket to money and luxury. Parasite is a brilliantly shot movie. It's very much a product of its country of origin."

Much like Bong Joon Ho's previous work, Snowpiecer (2013), the question of why some people are seen as ""lower"" and some people are seen as ""higher"" class is asked. The film also explores what we have to sacrifice to change social classes under a capitalist system. The narrative follows the Kims, a poor family who con their way into becoming the servants of a rich family, the Parks. Their easy life gets complicated when their deception is threatened with exposure. What follows is a fascinating spectacle which is sometimes operatic in nature and a sad reflection of modern life. Although it is all set in South Korea, the story works so well because it is universal and could have been set practically anywhere. It could be argued that there are no villains in the film, just people; however, it is anything but a soap opera. It is a commentary on the human condition. Nothing is black and white, just shades of grey. Parasite offers a way of seeing the world which feels unlike anything most Western audiences have seen before. However, there are still some films which it does bear some stylistic similarities to. Hitchcock comes to mind with films such as Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). There is also a twist in the tail which does feel slightly Hitchcockian. I could also see traces of films with a more biblical and spiritual quality to them such as Paul Thomas Anderson's Magnolia (1999). The acting was convincing throughout with stand out performances from Kang-ho Song and Sun-kyun Lee which puts the audience on edge. The spider-like way Bong Joon Ho directed his cast to move added to the sense of uneasiness. The writing is spot on with some razor sharp wit which, combined with the direction, made for some side-splitting moments. However as a contrast to the more humorous points in the film, there are moments of real sadness and pain. The contrasts beautifully represent life, because what is life if not a series of contrasts?"

Notions of class hierarchy have been told and retold by cinema over the decades. Predominately attached to the socioeconomic spectrum, stratification has always stirred up a profound impact on societies' minds when it comes from caustic satires or reactive commentaries. Ranging from Michael Bay's greedy paradox ""Pain & Glory"" to Alfonso Cuaron's autobiographical black-and-white gem, from Sean Baker's thoughtful portrait of post-financial crisis in ""The Florida Project"" to Paul Feig's Oscar-nominated powerhouse ""Bridesmaids"", capitalist prototypes and social dynamics have come and gone in all sorts of unimaginable shapes to bring out the inner demons of human survival. In times of cholera and uncertainty, Bong Joon-Ho's latest and buzziest masterpiece comes like a head-turning accomplishment, a surgically accurate class fable, a truly gripping multi-genre piece of entertainment, and a reinvigorating storytelling-rich decade-new awake. Ever since its Palme d'Or win, ""Parasite"" has been ground-breaking new history, not only by becoming the very first non-English language, non-epic-length period drama nabbing the Best Picture award at the 2020 Oscars ceremony- golden ticket Cuaron's ""Roma"" lost to polarizing, preachy ""Green Book"" back in 2019 -but by giving new life into movie-going experience in an aging era of convoluted streaming-service battles and rowdy franchise-building tentpoles. In a way, ""Parasite"" feels like the ""Inception"" of this new century. Back in 2010, Christopher Nolan's towering 160-million Russian doll odyssey opened several doors industry-wise, putting the absolute, always-coveted formula into one single movie: crushing box office incomes, cerebral, wholly original storytelling, and, above else, priceless craftsmanship power. However, Nolan did not treasure any social-resounding message as sharply as Bong Joon-Ho did overseas. ""Parasite"", on the other hand, is a small-budgeted, South-Korean thinking piece that, even while managing different procedures- it turned out to be more profitable than Nolan's pic -comes to the very same conclusion: great filmmaking is the key. Social-headed slices of art would never be about big budgets and small films like ""Get Out"" and ""The Invisible Man"" are proving that studios, either big or small, may still conquer audiences with entertaining, on-point storytelling."

Joker - 11 Oscar noms. (why?) Parasite? 6. (all deserved). Basically, the Oscars are more of a joke with each passing year. However in saying that, at least they gave 6 nominations to Parasite, which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for Best Film.

It did not follow the typical three act story, instead, it is like watching two movies in one: the first part, a comedy or satire, the second part was more like a thriller. However, the screenplay and the photography made both parts feel as a whole. During the 132-minute movie, it put the audience through many different emotional states. It is a movie that develops many topics resulting from the capitalist world and the increasing difference of the wealth of the rich people and the misery of the poor. It explains the differences between the social classes, emphasizing not only how the opportunities are different for both, but also how climate change affect them differently. However, is not the typical movie that romanticizes the working class, but rather show them with disunity among them and as people who live from the wealth of their masters and do not hesitate to smash others for a little bit of wealth. Moreover, both classes do not seem to understand nor show some care among them. The wealthy people live from the work of the poor, while the poor live from the wealth of the rich...then, who is the parasite, are there more than one? Another thing the director shows in this movie is the social death resulting from poverty. All this is shown in screen through a complex yet understandable symbolism and the mood is perfectly settled with the music. The photography and editing is also really good, my favorite part was a montage with combined more than 20 scenes. A piece of art to enjoy!"

Bong Joon Ho, the acclaimed director of Snowpiercer brings us this amazing masterpiece, a grueling story of the lengths people will go to come out of a desperate situation. All I will say of the story is that in its core it's the tale of two families, a very wealthy family that has everything, yet they have nothing, and a very impoverish family that has each other to a fault. But when their worlds collide there is bound to be a catastrophic catharsis. In the age of remakes, sequels and reboots it is very hard to find a movie that is not only very original in its premise, but that it also manages to amaze you and shock you to the very core, to your very foundation. The movie is very well shot, and it has amazing performances, specially from Woo-sik Choi and So-dam Park, who is rapidly becoming a rising star among Korean actresses. The film won four Academy Awards, and it deserves every single one of them, it is well-paced, the story is engaging, it has amazing performances, an astonishing photography, and it is masterfully put together by a visionary director, whose unapologetic take to show the ugly side of humanity makes this movie unforgettable.

Next only to 2017's 'The Shape of Water', 'Parasite' is the most unusual film ever to take home the Oscars for Best Picture and Director (but deservedly on both counts). Fun and memorable."

Many have made a point about this and they are right. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, you want to talk about everything. Performances, story and all of it. If you don't mind the subtitles go for it. I am expecting there to be an American remake anytime soon. So watch it before it becomes a thing. Especially now with the Golden Globes win and Oscar recognition (both deservedly!). South Korean cinema especially concerning drama and thrillers is really something I can advise anyone to watch. The quality is high and there are many things to discover. Not to mention they deliver surprises for anyone watching ... which is a good point for this movie too!"

The genre of the film is absolutely different from other Hollywood's franchises, trust me (Bong Joon-ho was right!). This review doesn't contain spoilers (although I do recommend to not read this before you watch the film). ""Parasite"", directed by a an artist himself Bong Joon-ho, is a social satire comedy-tragedy film that, like the film ""Us,"" tells of two families of different status, one of whom lives in the basement apartment and in unemployment condition. Each member of the poor family plans to sneak into a wealthy family's estate until they are exposed to unexpected twists. The film won the Palme d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival and the Sydney Film Festival at the Sydney Film Festival, and in fact, it deserved and won these awards (Eat Straw, Pulp Fiction). Why? Now comes the twist. On the one hand, Bong uses a very creative black comedy, as I will describe below, to improve stories of inequality, economic imbalance, inherent corruption and power abuse that reflect South Korean society's view. And on the other hand, all seven Bong films cover the genres, from science fiction to police proceduralism to the small-town murder mystery, but they all have many things in common. Such as: in the films ""Mother"" and ""Memories of Murder,"" Bong uses his films to reflect the problematic establishment of Korea, South Korea in particular, and the perfect results. As mentioned, this film is ignored by the genre's conventions: it's soft and cruel; Beautiful and hard; Beautiful and tragic and a masterpiece in her classroom investigation. The screenwriters, Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin Won, use a lot of twisted sleeves in the plot to make the movie more entertaining this year. Each line is delivered smoothly, as if these characters seem to be real people living in this story, with Jung Jaeli's classic score playing tremendously in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo distinguishes itself from a more realistic grainy style in the basement apartment, to a smoother style when focusing on our rich characters. This point of view causes us to look at two very opposing groups of people differently to make it even clearer that they do not belong to the same world. The classroom systems did not look earthy but still perfect before. Bong makes sure to simplify the lines between the two sides at certain points and cause your sympathy to jump back and forth with hectic consequences."

Beautiful dark cinematography. This movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for. The surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop. With a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest. Starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual. Lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse. Every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated. Do yourself a favor and watch this film.

I knew nothing about this movie going into it and I think that's the best way to go into it. I actually thought it was a sci fi/horror thing based on the title. It's not. It's socio-economic commentary, which I'm sure doesn't make it sound interesting but it is an absolute must watch. Up there with Oldboy in quality."

Sarcasm, humor, emotion, human condition, suspense, thriller, social issues, drama, thought provoking dialogues, strong and smooth acting - all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style. It is an unconventional storytelling, it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor. The beauty of cinema lies in its frame, because that's the window through which we watch and experience the story. And that's where comes the cinematography and the production design, it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision , every frame, every shot is unforgettable. Another unconventional part of this movie is it's background score, we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos. May be the background score is inspired from Hitchcock movies. This film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching, it stays with you, even if you want you can't escape from them, then slowly you learn to live with them in your head, because you are also one of them. It is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again, probably because you want to laugh, cry and get scared - all at the same time. Parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence. Kudos to Director Bong Joon-ho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone, forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world."

I cannot describe how thankful I am that this gem has been given a wide release in Australia before most countries, which is a rare occurrence, especially with foreign films. The first time I saw this, I was absolutely enthralled by it because of the unique story being presented. I found it to be witty yet subversive, and I had no idea where it was headed. Bong-Joon Ho is a director who's work that I've seen at this point is something I greatly appreciate. He always manages to pull genuinely funny comedy out of his scenes that somehow feels natural rather than jarring. It doesn't diminish from the story's overall seriousness, nor does it ditract from the dramatic performances of the cast, especially Song Kang-Ho, who I have not seen give a performance that was not great yet. Where the story did head completely caught me off guard, but in a good way. It is one of the best uses of plot escalation I have seen in a long time, to the point where the film completely changes genres halfway through and it's astounding because it works so well. The stylistic features change with the tone shift as well, as the score becomes more tense and dramatic, and the camera movement becomes more sweeping and eratic. It's all so perfectly complementary to what's escalating on screen. The cinematography is so good that any shot could be used as the poster, and it would make good one at that. The second time I saw this I payed extra attention to any hints or details that are presented which set up the escalation to come, and it was a truly rewarding experience. I think there's still things I won't pick up until my third or fourth viewing. I absolutely adore this film, and I think everyone should check it out. I would even recommend it to those who confess to not liking foreign films because they have to go through the gruelling task of actually having to read what they're watching. This is my favourite of 2019 so far, and I would be very surprised if that changed from now."

The hard truth is, you have to go into it completely blind, because its one those films that can surprise you at any turn, essentially there are no words to describe this superb South Korean thriller but simply it's director: Bong Joon-ho. This is pure Bong, it's insane, if you were to put it into one single genre you would a very hard to find trying to find which genre it would slot into, is it a horror? A thriller? A crime-caper? A comedy? Or is it just a drama? It's all of them, and none of them at the same time. But in a way in that sense that's the way that Bong creates his cinema, just for him, the man has no one genre he has not one single technique in his directing style. From his first film in 2000 Barking Dogs Never Bite, to Memories of Murder, through his monster invasion flick The Host, Snowpiercer and there's even no way to describe his last film Netflix's Okja they are all him. And his seventh film Parasite goes completely crazy in fact we're not sure if it's trying to be a meticulous crowd-pleaser or a mindbending thriller or an Art-house caper. The point is where he is trying to go he does it successfully. From the opening reel it'll have you intrigued and it scratch you out until you are unwillingly bridled to watch it again and again... And why shouldn't you? It's perfect - the plot is watertight, the Kim family are poor and penniless and utterly hopeless, they are getting tired of their stingy underground basement apartment so the eldest son (Woo-shik) seeks out other opportunity besides living in squalor conditions. So he has a plan to work for the wealthy Park family in their stunning mansion, liking what he sees he decides to bring the rest of his family along for the ride, and for a while everything is going fine until the rise of an unfortunate incident. And that's when everything changes. Intrigued? Well, that's enough. Because when it comes to Bong it's not the story that matters its the way his characters are written, the way they delve into making new plans for the well-off Park family. No. What the story is a about, is family."

A most deserving winner, especially in Original Screenplay and Best Picture categories. Only 10/10 I have given to a film, out of nearly 100 reviews. I am not sure what genre Parasite is. I laughed, stood in the edge of my seat and got emotional all throughout a very compelling 2 hours and 20mins run time. Parasite is a brilliant story about a poor family living in Seoul who tries to entrench themselves as workers in the house of the super wealthy Parks. The contrasts between two lifestyles are beautifully portrayed and yet, unlike most movies, the rich ones are not made out to be jackasses or bad apples. They are merely a family. Certainly different, flawed, but not one you will actively root against. The script is one of the most engaging I have ever seen. Builds at a perfect pace with the story and yet is positively full of suspense. The acting is incredibly convincing, especially the poor family's patriarch Kim Ki-taek, who goes through a very wide range of emotions. I have trouble pinpointing what else makes it so great, but the film flew by for me. I loved every bit of it. Bong Joon-Ho created a masterpiece a very worthy recipient of the first Best Picture academy award for a non-English language film. It will certain open many others for others to follow him. A must watch. PS: the only movie that Parasite remotely reminded me off is Hirokazu Koreeda's Shoplifters (2018)"

Everyone said ""The one rule about Parasite is that you don't talk about Parasite"". So I went to see Parasite. So this is a review about Parasite without talking about Parasite. Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) is a student living with his family in poverty in a sub-basement room, sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living, of sorts, by assembling pizza boxes. Opportunity presents itself when his best friend, the slightly older Min (Seo-joon Park), goes abroad to study. For Min is an English tutor to the up-market Park family's school-age daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Not wanting his fellow 'frat-boys' to move in on future romance - he's lined up Ki-Woo as his replacement. Ki-woo knows he's lucked in when he visits the swanky Park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of Da-hye's not too bright mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). But the influence of the family's ""lucky rock"" doesn't stop there. Ki-woo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister Kim (So-dam Park), his father Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) and his mother Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang). And gradually the poor Kim family start to encroach on the rich Park family's lives. You might think that's the story. It's not. Just when you think you know where the film is going - a gentle comic tale with farcical elements - the movie takes a sudden left turn into The Twilight Zone. To say more, if you've not seen the film, would be cruelty beyond measure. It's a truly astonishing script, by writer/director Bong Joon Ho, and my nomination for the Oscar for best original screenplay. It's the details that get to you. This will be a superb film to watch multiple times. There are fabulous details scattered throughout. You know how the more expensive the car the more ""solid"" the clunk is as you shut the door? Listen to the sound effect when the Park front door shuts! Look what happens to the ""one of a kind"" lucky rock! As for one of my favourite films from last year - ""The Farewell"" - you very quickly get to accept and embrace the subtitles. YOU MUST NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. This is a masterpiece of cinema, well-deserving of its multiple Oscar nominations and its Cannes Palme d'Or award. At 132 minutes, it's not a short film, but seldom have two hours flown by faster. It's totally gripping. At times hysterically funny; at times shocking. A class struggle movie of a calibre that Ken Loach would never have imagined! Gripes? I had just one."

The visual storytelling here is immaculate, the stair sequence, in particular, is incredibly crafted.The sound design and soundtrack are superbc subtle and strong in all the right places.This is probably the best-paced film I've seen this year, there's virtually nothing I could think of to trim. I am deliberately avoiding talking about the film in more specific terms, you don't need me for plot summary there's plenty of that online already. Though I would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible. Family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps. The acting is all excellent. Song Kang-ho continues to be one of the best actors working today. The dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other. I'm not really able to talk about this film at length without spoiling it so I'll just say if you're a true fan of film, this is not one you can miss.

Director Bong Joon Ho has dabbled in murder mysteries, dystopian science fiction, as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh, empathise, grin, and sit at the edge of your seat. By winning the Palme D'or at Cannes and hosting sold out screenings, Parasite had placed Bong Joon Ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema. The best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it, but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection. Not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters. Which brings me praise Kang-Ho Sok, who plays the father of the Kim family, making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family. The cinematography in Parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of Kim family's semi-basement house and polished expanse of park family's uptown villa. The background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in, while enhancing the drama. While Parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level, it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages. It communicates class divide, makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves, and makes you question: who is the real parasite in the movie? Watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves."

And it was a deserved win. Like ""Joker"", it employs some unusual methods to address class conflict in modern society. To crown everything, it takes a subtly comedic approach to the topic! A lot of people had never heard of Bong before this movie. I've known about him ever since I saw ""The Host"". I've seen a couple of other Korean movies in addition to his movies. If this movie gets people interested in Korean cinema, then all the better; some great movies come from there. But in the meantime, this movie probably says more about modern society than just about any other movie from last year. Definitely see it."

It was the recipient of the Palm D'Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews. It's an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best films of the past ten years. I won't say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away, but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible, extremely wealthy family. The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary. The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society, but also in the world as a whole. From there, its main raison d'être expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations. The results are shocking, startling, hilarious, and utterly brilliant. Such results certainly couldn't be achieved without a truly outstanding cast, but lucky for us, Bong Joon-ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble. Even more impressive is the film's character development. While the film's primary characters are often not the most ethical, they are surprisingly likable and multi-dimensional--especially when heightened by both emotion and tone. You'll certainly remember them long after the credits roll. But what's most unforgettable about ""Parasite"" is that the film manipulates (in the best way possible) its tone in so many unique and engaging ways, that it is able to fully subvert the viewer's expectations of not only how the film will go, but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions. Combining laugh-out-loud, witty comedy, taut suspense, and moments of pitch-black darkness, viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years. While such tonal shifts may sound erratic, they could not have been done more perfectly here--so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone--especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film's almost impeccable tightness, not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged. One review cited in the film's trailer calls ""Parasite"" a ""magic trick."" I couldn't agree more, both literally and figuratively. A definite 10/10."

It opens with the Kim family (Chung-sook (wife), Ki-taek (husband), Ki-jung (daughter), Ki-woo (son)) in their semi-basement apartment, the perfect setting for this working class household struggling to keep their heads above ground. They rely on their neighbours for free wi-fi while they sit on the kitchen floor folding pizza boxes for cash. A friend of Ki-woo's has been tutoring the daughter of a wealthy family (the Park's) and when a replacement is needed, Ki-woo, with the help of his document forging sister, fakes his way into the job. The Parks require a significant amount of help to run their household and as such need an art teacher for their son, a driver for the father, and a housekeeper to maintain their luxurious home. The Kim's are a clever clan and find a way to infiltrate each of these positions through cunning and deceit, often usurping previous help. By this point, we understand enough to see that this is a film about class conflict. The Kim's appear to be the protagonists with a grand plan, and you'd expect the Park's to be characterized as either villainous or ignorant, but they're neither. They're quite a nice family, only they're focused on their own objectives. When the Park's leave for a weekend of camping, the Kim's take over the home, boasting and toasting their good fortune. Mid soirée they're interrupted by an unexpected visitor and that's when the action really begins. The film's screenplay is too unique to be classifiable and the twists and turns too unexpected to reveal. If my recommendation isn't enough, the film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, a universal festival, unlike the Oscars which Bong called ""a local festival"" as part of his press tour to the tittering of film lovers. The film is distinctly Korean, but broadly relatable as we all live under the zero sum game of capitalism. Bong asks, who is the parasite? The labour class who need a job to survive, or the wealthy, who can't survive without their labour?"

The main cast is truly spectacular, with Kang-Ho Song and Cho Yeo-jeong providing for the best of the supporting performances. The dialogue is rich and relatable, and the humor in the film is well executed and surprisingly often. The film's pacing is by far one of its most brilliant remarks, with you never truly feeling bored throughout the almost 2 and a half hour runtime, and thoroughly entertained without. The film simply never stops, it doesn't shy away from different styles and genres of storytelling, but embraces them as one story and does it so cleanly, it truly is quite impressive. The cinematography is outstanding, with some truly beautiful visuals and captivating points of view. Though there are many interesting twists and turns that you may never truly see coming, the film can be a bit predictable at times with certain situations, and makes the film seem slightly less special in doing so. In the end however, Parasite is yet another brilliant work from Director Bong Joon-Ho and is one of, if not, the best work he has made to date. My Rating: 9.75/10"

Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own."

Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home, but it's two hours since we keep on discussing it- enough to rate it with 10 stars- which happens very seldom, I must admit. I am no connoisseur of Korean films, so I am not entitled to place it here or there, nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top. Is it a satire, a comedy, a thriller, a social fresco, a mystery? It's all of them and then some. It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours. It was informative of Korean lifestyle. It was entertaining. It was gruesome. It was comic. It was satirical. It was endearing. It was never boring. Not only the actors are great in it, but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast. As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film- both the favela style ones and the super rich ones. Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully. Not anymore, although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically. Parasite made me laugh, made me cringe, made me question life, gave me food for thought. What more should I expect from a film? To watch it again, clearly!"

And this one did just that. Packed with terrific direction, commendable performances from the whole cast, the sheer excellence in story writing and screenplay alongside some beautifully crafted cinematography this film is surely a treat in every category. It made me think, it made me curious about the nuances and the small details and hints it got all over it. I just couldn't express the feelings I got watching this. In one word it's truly a masterpiece! It Won 4 academy awards this year, and that's not a mean feat! Making history at the oscars by winning the best film award as a foreign film for the first time ever. It alone portrays how much this film has been applauded by the critics, the industry people and us ; the audience. This is one of those rare movies where majority of us have the same opinion about. It's entertaining, thrilling, with some dark twists and some disturbing scenes as well that will surely make an impact in your mind. I assure you ; this movie will be in your head for a very long period of time! It brilliantly exposes the capitalism system in society that has been presented as the 'Parasite' in here. The class difference, the economical boundaries set by the same people. It does symbolise with every aspect of the core issues that every major society in the world currently faces. One thing That I absolutely loved about it was the simplistic way it took to handle those sensitive subjects. And it can be applicable to any country though it's been made having Korean culture and society in mind ; this story, would be relatable to everyone. No matter the country Someone lives in. But you need to give your sincere focus and intellectuality while watching as it demands that. Every scene there has been crafted metaphorically. And those clever set ups can only be observed thoroughly if you are paying enough attention. Every character and their actions represent something. And you need to find that connection. And don't worry you will ; as the direction has been top notch throughout the entirety of the film. The character developments and The hidden metaphors are a treat to watch and experience. My own personal tip would be to avoid every promo, trailer and articles before watching it. Going with a blank slate will help you to digest every bit of it naturally. Enough of the review now, I just wanna say, go and watch this film immediately."

I personally love foreign films, especial horror and thriller films from South Korea. I have loved every movie I have seen thus far of director Bong Joon Ho's and this is no different. The film follows the members of a poor household scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals. The actors in this movie bring their A-game and showcase all different levels on the screen. There are all able to showcase their comedic side as well as darker capabilities when needed. This is the rare occasion when there are no standouts because there are on the same level. Just brilliant performances all around. The story is so original and tightly executed. It may get a little confusing because things tend to happen quickly, and information can get lost. It is beautiful shot, this its camera angles and wide shots inside the house. It showcases different class types in society perfectly and how some rich look down on the poor and it gets under your skin. Overall, the movie is great for those who don't mind subtitles. However, if you do mind subtitles or have not tried foreign film, I promise you that you're missing out on a whole other world of cinema. I was going to give this movie 4.5 stars because I didn't just want to jump on the bandwagon with people loving this movie, but it deserves more than that. It is an absolutely flawless film. 5/5"

First of, the dialogue is brilliant. With it constantly working on multiple levels, first making you understand and care about these characters, then learning dribs and drabs of their schemes and finally subtly setting up dialogue which is then brilliantly reincorporated to fuel emotional powerhouses of performances within the explosive finale. This is all whilst it being incredible natural and just out right human, there are so many instances of character inflection which tell you so much about each and every person on screen. Especially when some of the characters later in the film are playing characters themselves, lines here and there are clearly said by either themselves or the character they're pretending to be and because of their fantastic set-up, you're able to immediately tell when they're being themselves or not on the turn of a dime. It manages to always perfectly balance it's comedic elements with the serious mystery thriller ones, always knowing exactly when and how to incorporate the two into the lives of the characters to create an amount of emotional connectivity to a film I haven't experience all year. The political satire and themes on class struggle are too, fascinating, they're intrinsically baked into the narrative and backstory of the characters without ever being in your face or obnoxiously telling you what to think, so when they are brought up for a narrative beat or for you to get an emotional read on someone, you're free to interpret and analyse them as much or as little as you want. Joon-Ho has at some points made the political ideologies a bit too apparent in his films which has come across as almost lecturous in Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013). Thankfully this has never been detrimental to the final product, but I think the political statements within Parasite are here to create a better emotional connection to these characters, rather than blatantly tell you about the political climate you already know about. By making you care about all these different and unique characters and using the political themes to set the stage for the story, when the themes on class struggle come to a head within the narrative you for one actually care about them because they're affecting character's you understand and like, and secondly they're then far more interesting to delve into and think about because the film never asked you too."

Yes, they are! 'Oldboy', ""The Man From Nowhere"", ""I Saw The Devil"", ""The Chase"" etc. etc. You name it. Korean directors are masters when it comes to deliver messages about social taboo or to execute a thriller on screen in possibly the most perfect way. 'Parasite' adds and in fact stretches the legacy of Korean films in even broader perspective. Genres can be deceptive at times for some cinematic creations. And for films like 'Parasite', it spans over a wide sphere for sure. Kudos to the director Bong Joon-ho for giving this masterpiece which is multi-layered and shows the economic inequality in the pro-capitalist society of South Korea in a way which consists so much mixed emotions, sense of humour, lots of adrenaline rush, few nail-biting moments as well; all revolve around primarily two economically contrasting families. It pin-points out the drawbacks of extreme capitalism and plutocracy in its usual neo-noir black comic style, which will eventually grows on the minds of the audience. No wonder why this cinematic gem has got almost 10 mins of standing ovation at the Cannes and has won 4 Oscars at the 92nd Academy Awards including ""The Best Picture"" award as a Non-English film for the first time ever in the history of the Academy Awards.

I was only 16, but I made sure from then on I would see all the things he directs. When he began getting so much praise and attention in 2019 for ""Parasite,"" I was a little worried. I wasn't a fan of ""Snowpiercer"" (although it is well crafted), and when he worked with Netflix in 2017 to direct ""Okja,"" I was even more disappointed. But this afternoon, with my parents, I saw ""Parasite"" at Cinemark before the Oscars. As my previous review of it says, it is now one of my all time favorite films I've ever seen. I figured, however, given the Academy's fancy for war films, I just knew ""1917"" would take home the award for Best Motion Picture of the Year, and in all fairness, that was an amazing film. When Jane Fonda opened the envelope and stared for a moment, I was worried that the one film I wasn't terribly impressed with, ""Ford v. Ferrari,"" was the winner. Again, that was a technical feat for sure, but in my book it was the only one nominated for the best pic category that I felt it didn't deserve the win. Jane Fonda, with surprised grandness (and obvious shock), announced that one word: ""Parasite."" There are many films that have won Best Picture that I've gushed over (remember my obsession with ""The Shape of Water""?), but this announcement made my heart leap with elation; that same sensation you get when your crush kisses your cheek and whispers ""I like you too."" Bong Joon Ho...I am so happy for you."

I would say that this is the most divine work of cinema I've seen in many many years. Some people refrain from watching foreign language films. I find myself paying more attention to the plot since I have to read what is being said. This is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment, which this one does.

It is a film that defies genre, blending comedy, tragedy, and a thriller into a symphony of cinematic elements that harmonize into an unforgettable experience. The film begins innocuously enough, with the Kim family, a quartet of lovable rogues, struggling to make ends meet in their semi-basement apartment. Their lives are a series of small hustles, folding pizza boxes for meager wages while they leech off the Wi-Fi of nearby businesses. It's a life of squalor, yet depicted with a warmth that endears us to the Kims from the outset. When Ki-woo, the son, is given the opportunity to tutor for the wealthy Park family, the film shifts gears. The Parks live in an architectural marvel of a home, a stark contrast to the cramped quarters of the Kims. It's not just a different dwelling; it's a different world. The lush lawns, the sterile spaciousness, the casual opulence - it all speaks of a life unattainable for the Kims, until they begin to insinuate themselves into the Parks' household. What follows is a series of cons and deceptions, each more audacious than the last, as the Kims slowly infiltrate the Parks' lives. There's a delicious tension in watching the Kims weave their web, a sense of giddy anticipation as each new lie is told, each new scheme is hatched. Yet, there's an underlying pathos too, a commentary on the desperation that drives the Kims to such lengths. Bong Joon-ho's direction is impeccable. He navigates the tonal shifts with a deft hand, ensuring that the humor never undermines the tension, and the suspense never overshadows the film's social commentary. The cinematography is equally adept, with shots that linger just long enough to let the unease set in, or quick cuts that heighten the absurdity of a situation. The performances are stellar across the board. Song Kang-ho, as the patriarch of the Kim family, brings a weary charm to his role. He's a man beaten down by life but not broken, and there's a twinkle in his eye that suggests he's in on the joke. Cho Yeo-jeong, as the Park family matriarch, is wonderfully naive, a woman so insulated by wealth that she's blind to the realities of the world around her. ""Parasite"" is a commentary on the human condition, a reflection on the lengths to which people will go to climb out of the pits of poverty."

It can't be that good, can it!? Did the judges not see 1917! Is what I hear you cry as you even read the title of this review. From the mind of Bong Joon-ho comes a drama about class and home invasion, but truly can it be THAT good? Lest we forget this is the mind behind the uncompromising vision of Snowpericer and the unsettling onslaught that was Okaj... but even still, it can't be better than Joker? Right? There is a surreal kind of desperation that follows you while watching Parasite, you want to see the ultimate fate of our protagonist sooner than is given. The real tilting point of the movie comes around the halfway mark when a troubling discovery is made, this propels the film from contemporary melodrama into an all-out descent into madness, this is where Bong Joon-ho thrives. In the chaos, in the distress, this is where Bong Joon-ho forces us as an audience to be. Parasite has a rare kind of delicacy to it as if Bong Joon-ho doesn't want to upset us too much, but what's to keep us unsettled. He wants to make us dread for the next turn of events, and as the final curtain falls, you know you have just seen a masterpiece. However, I am unsure if this would not be better suited to a stage production rather than the grandiose of a film. The movie has nothing in it which makes me feel like it must be seen at a cinema, but perhaps that is to its ultimate asset. A film that transcends how you view it and is outstanding on its own merits. The most adequate comparison I can make for Parasite is a Shakespearean play. The film has moments of levity and comedy, blended in with horrible and tragic scenes, and is divided into acts. It has deep pathos and there is something overall cathartic about the whole experience. This is the first film of Bong Joon-ho's that is set in a reality which is current and we (as the viewer) inhabit, despite this, there is still a surreal and other world quality to the proceedings, not unlike Alice In Wonderland. Bong Joon-Ho beckons us through the looking glass. Perhaps Parasite's strongest suit is its characters who are exceptionally well balanced, there is nothing as obvious as a villain or hero in Parasite. No, the film leaves this up to us, as the viewer to pick out who we feel was correct in their actions most. Make no mistake Parasite's is a world filled with fallen humans."

No position is final. Every life is there to improvise, when the chance is. No fixed values, don't fool yourself. No fixed position (though, society place their limits - or gives opportunities) - it all can change unexpectedly at any given moment. No main roles - each life is a role in itself. So - what's the value? Well, whatever conservative it may sound (especially for a motion-picture like this one) - family values. That's your opportunities, your backup - add some lottery and improvisation - life depicted. Lot of points to the story told (and how), and to actors' play. Lots of points to all the different prospectives - as you see the unrolling event from all the eyes of all the engaged persons (it is a value that many of today RPG have - you can play as any of persons involved - and see from their point of view - and feel their values). I wouldn't call it a drama, neither a ""social comedy"" though. It isn't a detective story either. It's a very talented director's work, play-writer's as well (ah, he's the same one...). It's an amazing cast. And it's more than fairly valued/rewarded - with the ""golden palm"" and a lot of ""oscars"" (despite critics' grumble - what so many ""oscars"" given for...). That one surely goes into a world cinematic library - to be a modern classic."

Some are convoluted mindgame mazes that force you to solve riddles or to stay forever lost. And then there's this film. A traditional Asian gift of layers upon layers of wrapping, each concealing and disguising not just the shape but the essence of what's inside. And in the end, the gift might not be what's in there, but the act of unwrapping itself. I'm amazed how Bong Joon Ho tricks us into believing that this is a cheap con artist comedy at first. It was almost natural to shout ""No way! This can't be the film everyone's raving about!"". Had I recalled that this man has also written Snowpiercer, I would not have been so simple. Just like the rich family whose house the parasites have invaded, naive and gullible, ready to call the number on the first business card given, we fall into the traps of easy interpretations, and Bong knows it well enough, giving us all these hints we understand only after a while. Parasite is definitely not about the action, and maybe not even about the visual brilliance, although the scene of running down the stairs, equally physical, social and psychological, under the rain is a phenomenally executed message, just like a scene of an elevated toilet bowl regurgitating back what it's fed up taking in is an image only a person who made two Oscars kiss could come up with. In terms of graphic expression and witty dialogues, Parasite could make both Tarantino and Miyazaki proud, all at the same time. This is no doubt a fancy wrapping, but the best thing about this film is what you feel through it. From condescending disbelief, to light interest, to full engagement, to the sense of watching a social message play within a movie, to feeling as if no borders of genre or common sense exist at all, to feeling dumbfounded and uncomfortable, to a sudden calm. As if a petty half-penny story has taken you into a Zen parable. In the end, nothing remains. An experience that leaves you blank as a mountain side under the snow. So if you do see a light in the distance, don't rush to decode its signals. Just enjoy the scenery while it lasts. After all, it's what you came all the way up for."

When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo's, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants. This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas. However, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization! Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one."

Pairing Bong with the strong cast also makes the film a no-doubter masterpiece. At the end of the day, the colorful group of characters are what will be remembered the most, each and every one of them is worth savoring and are honestly beautifully crafted. Bong is also able to illustrate the inner psyche of class difference in Asian societies, where class discrepancy is wide and is one of the most significant social issue. The film is able to dive into this through a creative story that perhaps wouldn't exist anywhere else in the world, and could be food for thought for both spectrums of the scale."

It's a rare film you will remember for its sheer personality and exciting twists and turns. It's best to go into this film knowing as little as possible. The family of con artists sees its fortunes take a turn when one day the son by pure chance gains access to the residence of a super wealthy family. The rest should be found out on screen as this film proceeds at a visceral pace and never misses at beat. Performances are strong all around but the father of the family of criminals is brilliantly portrayed by Song Kang-ho, as he embodies all the boldness and fears of a devoted parent who will do anything to provide for his family, however shady and immoral his choices become. He also exemplifies the steadfast defiance of a working class man who refuses to be held down by those more powerful. The rock of the family, he is one of the most likeable protagonists ever. For all the vitality and edginess of this film, there is also a residual melancholy feel to the story. Through all the bitter class struggle and criminal audacity at work here, there remains a lingering shred of human dignity. Grandly recommended."

Thats the basic/general premise for Parasite, and don't look anything else up about this movie beacuse make no mistake, this is a movie best experienced by knowing as little as possible, it also just so happens to be one of, if not the best movie of the entire year aswell as Bong Joon Ho's entire career. Where to even begin with this one. Well let's start with the director himself. Ive always been a huge fan of Bong Joon Ho's. The Host is one of my favourite monster movies and Snowpiercer is a fun ride aswell, however it's Memories of Murder that really impressed me. A perfectly constructed crime thriller which put Ho on the map. Ho is a extremely ambitious and confident filmmaker who seems to be always trying something new with every movie he makes. One thing that always strikes me and many other fans of Bong's work is the overall tone of his films. Just like his previous work parasite is really difficult to place into just one genre. At times it extremely funny and playful, the next minute it will be an nail biting thriller with a hint of horror. Bongs writing style is something that I have always enjoyed but here in particular It works extremely well. My favourite aspect of this movie (Besides basically everything) is the characters and the writing. Parasite is a movie that is examing social classes and showing the divide for what it truly is, in the film we see perspectives from both poor and rich families. With that in mind you may have some preconception of how these families are going to be shown based on what you have seen in the past. However you would be wrong. Ho manages to show both families with the same amount of respect as each other. His not trying to make the rich looks evil but at the same time not trying to make the poor look like saints. He is just showing human beings and the effect that these social class divides take on us. One thing that Bong Joon Ho said in the Q&A after the screening that struck me was: ""There are no Villains in this film"" and it's true. This all lends itself to a truly unique experience where you understand every characters motivations and understand the actions that they take, and in turn practically don't necessarily know who you want to come out on top. Just go support this movie if you get the chance."

PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling. Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance. PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)

Justly Celebrated.",2020-07-21,imdb,"Metaphors can be a problem in any piece of storytelling if the creator becomes so wedded to the metaphor that it al becomes either too obvious or too forced, and the narrative collapses under the weight of the meaning being attached to it. Simply describing the central metaphor of Parasite in the way it speaks to the film's theme of the rich-poor divide might make it seem that it's obvious, but it works deliciously. The plot is all sleek, smooth lines akin to the architecture of the house in which most of the film takes places; the metaphor is easy to grasp but never simplistic. Indeed this is one of those rare works of art that neither romanticises the poor nor demonises the rich, and it goes even better by excusing no one from their sins. It also switches genres deftly; from the delicate comedy of the first hour to the comedic drama/thriller of the second half. Other genre tropes are cleverly employed - especially hinting at aspects of horror and science-fiction, nodding more than once to HG Wells' War Of The Worlds amongst others. The film moves gracefully to a conclusion that's startling and that also seems somehow written in the stars; in the hands of an inferior artist it would be schlocky and clumsy; here it simply works as it's intended to. Similarly, the film's epilogue avoids sentimentality and manages to pack an emotional punch. That the film achieves all this within a seamless whole that is at once perfectly constructed but still humane and truthful is the reason is this film is so justly celebrated."

It feels totally fresh and has comedic moments which landed with the audience in the room whilst exploring much darker themes and moments.

Have I simply seen too many films? In 2016 and earlier, There were a whole bunch of films that I could say ""now that is one of the very best films I have ever seen."" Since 2017, the most that I could say about I film I love would have been ""I love this film. But I don't adore it...One of the best of the year, not ever."" Finally near the end of the decade comes a film I can comfortably say is one of the finest motion pictures I have ever laid eyes on. The movie is Korean so there are subtitles and it does run over two hours. But throughout that duration, time stands still. We are fully immersed in this tale of Shakespearean portions and Hitchcockian brains. 'Parasite' follows two families: the dirt poor Kims and the filthy rich Parks. Being on opposite ends of the social spectrum, many people interpret this as a social satirical film. I can see where they are coming from, but I didn't care about that. Many different themes such as identity are also looked at, but that is all just icing on the cake. Placing them on opposite ends of the spectrum just makes the story and characters another relationships all the more great. it is sad seeing the Kims in such bad living conditions, so we root for them right away to get out of the slums. Ki-woo is the son who aspires to get out of poverty by attending university. He is approached by one of his university friends who is going overseas to study to take over tutoring Park Da-hye in english. Ki-woo does not know English well, but figures he can fake it and make some money. he may be just a tutor, but it pays well. He finds out that the Parks are looking for a therapist for their son, so Ki-woo gets his sister to assume a new identity and be the boy's therapist. With more money coming and only two more people in the Kim family in need of a good job, it all seems like a sinch to get them in. But getting rid of people in their way and keeping their true identities under wraps from the Parks will be harder than they could fathom. 'Parasite' could be simplified as ""family vs family"" but there are a couple of more characters other than the regular family members that are all so interesting. Most movies cannot handle developing these many characters. They are smart, sympathetic, even likeable. The reason I call this film ""Hitchcockian"" is because of its power to thrill us and take the viewer to places they could never imagine."

And it definitely lived up to the hype. The Kim family struggles to get by as the father, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), is unemployed and are forced to live in run-down basement apartment in an already poor neighbourhood. Conning and manipulation is second nature to the family as it is their only means to ensure they come close to living. And once the opportunity comes in the form of the wealthy Park family needing a new English teacher for their teenage daughter, the Kim's young adult son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) takes the position to help his family get the money they need to escape their impoverished lifestyle. Through a series of planned and highly calculated manipulation and trickery, Ki-woo gets all of his family members employed but at the expense of getting the Park's previous driver and housemaid fired to steal their paid positions. Eventually the Kim's start living off the of the Parks's luxuries as if they entered the gates of heaven and awarded for their scheme. To explain anything more would ruin the rest of the story. The joy of it will be watching the twists unfold as the ideas and themes of Parasite take on a very unique and unexpected look at the class dynamic. The film portrays neither families as the hero or villain of this story. Similar to his English-language sci-fi thriller Snowpiercer, Bong Joon-ho dives deep into a surreal, abstract world to explore the class dynamic between the wealthy and the poor. The difference in this being neither side is worth rooting for nor against. The Kim's take advantage of the Parks's naivety through their con as the most sure-fire way to gain the benefits that are denied to them because of their class status. And so it means they are ignorant to the moral consequences made by their scam until it is too late. Meanwhile, the Parks are so condition to their wealthy and privileged lifestyle they are oblivious to how unfair they treat the lower class while being paranoid and frightened by what doesn't meet their high expectations. The cruel unexpected circumstances of the film's events prove no matter how well planned things go, the poor will still in the end be feeding off the scraps of the rich that blindly ignore them. Don't want to say anything much else about Parasite other then it is worth seeing without not much else about it. Go see it."

But I'd give it 9.5 if i could as it's my best 9/10 film I don't think this film would work in many other countries. Song Kang-ho who plays Ki Taek is superb as the main man.

First of all, I really liked the story of different social classes, despair, greed, deception, pride and prejudices. It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres. This is movie that I will gladly watch many times. A real gem of Korean cinematography."

Twisty, intelligent, and often laugh-out-loud funny, PARASITE is a movie that mixes and matches every genre from comedy to horror. It's beautifully shot and acted, definitely one of the best films to come out of 2019. Though it deals with South Korean society, its themes regarding the widening socioeconomic gap and the class-based prejudices which linger in our modern world are universal."

From the days of cavemen, the Roman Empire, the Enlightment, and even modern times, philosophers, scholars and storytellers have explored the ideology of the wealthy and poor. It's something that people have wanted to fix to create more equality and people that discuss whether things should be equal at all. It's hard to give my opinion because we have so many viewpoints that's its challenging to paint who exactly is in the wrong. There are good wealthy people and bad poor people and vice versa. This is also something that many movies has dived into. In fact, one of my favorite movies of the 2000's is the science-fiction thriller, Snowpiercer. It was a creative way to look at corrupted societies and how it unfavorably placed the poor without a way out. It's a movie with a lot of layers and Korean director Boon Joon-Ho knew it was important to make it just as entertaining as it was to explore and read into. It looks like he's made another movie about class, except Parasite is a smaller story about two families, but is still as impactful. We start with a family of four living in the slums, in a basement under a store; father Kim Ki-Taek (played by Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (played by Jang Hye-jin), son Kim Ki-woo (played by Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Kim Ki-Jeong (played by Park So-dam). They struggle for work enough that they take jobs constructing pizza boxes. When a friend of the son comes to visit, he offers Kim Ki-woo an English tutoring job to a wealthy family's daughter. He accepts and sees a world he only dreamt of; a fancy house built by a famous architect, wide space, a backyard and nice cars. After some convincing from the family, a scheme is made so that the daughter is hired as an art therapist for the youngest son, the father as a new driver/errand runner, and the mother as the new housekeeper. The family is overjoyed that their con has fooled the other family. This leads into them celebrating when the other family leaves for a camping trip by eating and drinking in the living room. Things go wrong when the previous housekeeper returns to get something. Though there is a second half to the movie, I can't talk about it without spoiling it. Parasite is one of those movies that spans a lot of genres, and yet keeps it focused enough to make it one of the best movies of 2019."

Equal parts thriller, drama, comedy, and suspense. While it is a scathing indictment on classism, it does an amazing job of condemning the institution and not necessarily the individual. It is in identifying with characters that Joon-ho really exposes the psychological hold economic class has on the individual and society.

I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10. Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is. I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways. What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013). And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them. I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell). Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others. When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."

This is a slowly evolving, funny and engaging film for those who have the ability to let the magic unfold without any expectations or needing an explanation for everything. Storyline and characterization are all that's needed for any film to work at a basic level and there is so much originality and depth here to keep the viewer engaged throughout the duration.

This is a domestic comedy/drama with universal undertones of class division that takes a dark turn in a climax that will leave you reeling. There are layers to the story which, without revealing the intricacies of plot, play on class tensions, identity and entrapment. A genre-bending tour de force from South Korea, deftly told by writer-director Bong Joon-Ho and brilliantly inhabited by an award-winning ensemble cast. In a meritocracy who is the parasite and who is the host? A cinematic ode to scratching below the surface of an all too perfect picture only to release a scurry of hidden roaches."

Having heard the near unanimous praise from peers and other reviews, I had high expectations for this film. It was also the first Korean film I watched. The movie starts, and I'm literally glued to my seat-it was very entertaining. The camera movement, the way the characters speaks, the overall pacing, the black comedy tone-everything was just so freshly packaged, I wanted a refill the moment the movie was over. A predominant theme of this movie is the class structure-from a non-Korean's point of view it was quite clear and somewhat tragic to see. If I had one problem with this film, I think some of the class struggle content was probably too overt (especially in the dialogue) and could have been handled more subtly. Despite that, it is definitely a film that deserved all the accolades it received. It is first movie that I watched in theaters where I instantly wanted to rewatch it. Now that folks, is entertainment."

I just want to point out that, in my opinion, director Bong Joon Ho does two things that separates and elevates this work from almost every other message-oriented/social commentary films. First, in order to convey his message, instead of for example, putting a guy in front of a microphone to look straight in the audiences' eyes and say that ""capitalism is bad"" or ""these rifts in society are killing our souls"" and alike, instead of doing that, he goes out of his way to masterfully create a story, a setting that will demonstrate the problems of a western capitalism module. He does indeed show us, not blandly tell us, that in a parasitic society, almost everyone can identify as a parasite, nonwithstanding their virtues and morales. It is left to audiences themselves to decide whether this story is believable or not, or rather whether this kind of story is something real or something manipulative. Secondly, I simply adored how perfect of a genre blend this film was. It easily classifies itself as a dark comedy, an edge-of-a-seat thriller, a drama, there are a few overt political elements mixed into it and we can even indulge in some delicious violent scenes, characteristic of south-eastern asian cinema. All in all, only a master of a craft, a seasoned veteran of this medium can take on such arduous task, such hazardous venture and come out triumphant."

I must reiterate that you will not leave this movie with a sense of innocence lost, like your first reading of The Lord of the Flies or your first watching of Oldboy. The comedy cuts through the perfectly balanced two hours and change experience that Bong Jong Ho has prepared for you.

Something that impressed me. The sad ending is somehow terrible because it's real. This is life and it's Hollywood to think it would be any different. I truly love the originality and full circle of the script, it's like if you write a master thesis that just hits home where you were able to tie all knots elegantly and with great content.

After viewing, not only does this film deserve to be talked about as one of the best films to be released in 2019, but I personally think this may just be the very best movie you'll see all year. Now, some people may not like the turn it takes, but here's why I think Parasite demands to be seen. To go into detail about this premise would be to ruin it for those who haven't seen it, so I'll stick to the basics here. The Kim family lives in a basement living space. All unemployed, they find any way they can to make things work. Ki-woo, the eldest sibling in the family, is given the opportunity to tutor the daughter of the rich Park family. Getting smarter and smarter as the first act really kicks into gear, the Kim family becomes a group of very clever con-artists. Meaning well and doing everything they can to keep things legitimate, this makes for some terrific tension. The biggest praise I can give this film is that it's constantly in motion, never wasting a moment to surprise you. The set-up for this movie has many clever aspects to it, the second act throws you a real curveball and the finale doesn't disappoint either. Some viewers may think this movie goes off the rails toward the end, but I found it to be an overall brilliant piece of storytelling. Each time you think the movie has said everything it wants to, it becomes that much more interesting. In other hands, this story could've have come off as a very generic film, but there's truly something special about how well-made Parasite is. Wonderfully shot by cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong, each frame of this movie has more than one thing to say. It's very rare these days that shot compositions are done in such a way that they seem to tell a story as well, but even in the moments when the focus is on the characters alone, there are things happening in the background or even signs in the framing that things are coming soon. This movie is brilliantly made in every way. It's very rare when I review a film and struggle to at least come up with one negative here, so I won't bother trying, because I loved this movie too much to let anything take away from it."

This Korean movie won the renowned Palme d'Or of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It has been selected as the South Korean entry for Best International Feature Film at the ninety-second Academy Awards. This movie combines multiple genres such as comedy, drama, horror, thriller and tragedy. The main theme is the clash between rich and poor in the Republic of Korea. This conflict has been the main topic in other great films such as The Housemaid and The Taste of Money. Parasite however is less cumbersome, melodramatic and moralizing and convinces with wit, depth and creativity instead. International audiences might feel slightly confused by this unusual genre mixture at first contact but this is exactly what makes this movie so unique. The story starts in a dramatic way and portrays a poor family who lives in a small semi-basement apartment and struggles to make ends meet. The movie gets more comedic when the son of said family gets the unexpected opportunity to replace a friend as English tutor for the beautiful daughter of a wealthy family. The film turns into a thriller when the four family members gradually infiltrate and even replace the personnel of the wealthy family with ethically questionable procedures. The movie turns into a horror film when the family realizes that the family mansion hides a creepy secret as things gradually spin out of control. The film ends as an almost surreal tragedy that will leave the audience speechless. Parasite is a movie the leaves a lasting impression, offers much food for thought and should animate philosophical discussions. The movie is so detailed, precise and profound that it deserves to be purchased to be watched time and again. I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to watch this movie in French in a Canadian cinema and so were the numerous other members of the audience in the packed movie theatre. People are craving for a change and are tired of tame, predictable and repetitive Hollywood superhero prequels, remakes and sequels. There should be more creative, dynamic and entertaining international movies like Parasite in movie theatres all around the world. If you desire to make a statement in favour of cinema as an artistic expression rather than shallow entertainment, do yourself a favour and enjoy this incredible movie on the big screen. This movie has the potential to become a cult classic and deserves all the praise it gets."

As the title states, this film is captivating from the very first scenes. I rather enjoy being drawn into a story by quick witted individuals and the family in Parasite are no exception. I will not go into the story as more professional writers than me have already done so. However, I will go into what I (a cinema fan) thought. The film is primarily driven by the plot. There is no need for violence (at least for a majority of the film) to keep you engaged. Each chapter in the film perfectly leads to the climax, allwhile being fed foreshadowing details that are revealed in the final act. Korean cinema is juxtaposed by American cinema, and we have to appreciate what they do differently, and better. If you want to have a good laugh, just sort this film's reviews by lowest rating first XD."

Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite."

At the end of the festival, the film got awarded the biggest price (Best Film) and distributor Madman Entertainment decided to ride that wave of interest in the film, releasing this Korean dark comedic masterpiece just a week later in Australian cinemas. Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sick) is a young man with not much to look forward to. He basically lives in a basement apartment with his scruffy dad Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), snappy mother Chung-sook (Hyae Jin Chang) and his clever sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam). Their tiny confined home feels too small to live in with four adults. They use free wi-fi from their neighbours and try to make some easy money by folding boxes for a pizza delivery company, until Ki-woo's friend offers him to take over a student to tutor. Faking a university diploma and a shameless backstory, Ki-woo introduces himself to a rich family in a dream house with the most well maintained lawn you've ever seen. Here he becomes the tutor to Da-hye (Ziso Jung), daughter of wealthy CEO Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his emotionally unstable wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong). Everything seems to go just as planned, until the almost perfectly executed plan starts to unravel more and more out of control. Scriptwriters Bong Joon-ho (who also directed) and Han Jin-won have so many twists up their sleeves to make this the most entertaining and well-written film you'll see this year. Every line gets delivered so smoothly, as if it seems like these characters are real people who are living through this story, with Jung Jae-il's classical score, masterfully playing in the background. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo differentiates itself from a more realistic gritty style in the basement apartment, to a more dreamlike perfectly slick style when focusing on our wealthy characters. This point of view makes us look at these two very contrasting groups of people in a different way, to make it even clearer that they don't belong in the same world. Class systems have never looked more down to earth yet perfect before. Though Bong wants you to feel for both parties, the lines will blur at certain points and make your sympathy for anyone bounce back and forth with feverish consequences. Everyone has a sense of selfishness to them when it comes to goals, but being nice doesn't take that much effort."

And with the element of surprise gone, I could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives. I especially liked that no one here is 100% blameless or 100% evil. That kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life. I only wish it were more common in movies. This time, I also paid much closer attention to the film's abundant symbolism. Admittedly, though, I still couldn't figure out the significance of the Scholar's Rock. But that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film.

As is the case with Bong Joon-ho's Parasite, they might also produce some of our time's most impressively original stories and supply timely commentary in the process. We meet the impoverished Kim family, father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho), mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter Ki-jeong (Park So-dam), and we soon learn they aren't the most honest bunch. Ki-woo, through his friend Min-hyuk, gets hired as a homeschool English teacher, using forged Oxford documents, at the home of the upper-class Park family; tech company CEO Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun), his stressed-out wife Yeon-gyo (a wonderful Cho Yeo-jeong), teen daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), and little Da-song (Jung Hyun-joon). This is but the beginning of the Kim family's sneaky ascent. Learning of Da-song's troubles, Ki-woo, going by ""Kevin"", informs Mrs. Park of an art therapist he knows named ""Veronica"", who is actually Ki-jeong, who may help Da-song evolve. Through a series of events I won't spoil, ""Veronica"" later gets the chance to recommend a new chauffeur for the Park family in the form of Ki-taek, going by ""Mr. Kim"", who in turn recommends a new housekeeper, played by Chung-sook. The way the Kims continually fool the Parks - from meticulous script recitations in their basement flat to ad-libbing based on research they've done for the fields they pretend to work in - is clever, tense, impossible to predict, and morbidly hilarious throughout. It is made even more amusing to behold thanks to how it's edited (for instance: cutting from Ki-taek lying to Yeon-gyo, to him finishing the same sentence during Ki-woo's rehearsals), how purposefully the staging and cinematography are done (the vast Park household juxtaposed against the cramped Kim residence), and how utterly believable these performances are. The actors who portray the Kims, in particular, give remarkably layered performances. Each actor is required to play the character in their natural environment, plus the roles they themselves assume when posing as the Park family's home employees. The characters themselves are convincing actors, hence their successful duping of the Parks, which makes each real-world actor's performance all the more considerable."

The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they scheme their way into the lives of the wealthy Park family, with each member posing as a highly qualified professional. What begins as a darkly comedic take on social mobility soon escalates into a tense, unpredictable thriller. Bong Joon-ho's direction is brilliant, seamlessly blending social commentary with gripping suspense, dark humor, and shocking twists. The film's tone shifts effortlessly between comedy, drama, and horror, keeping the audience engaged and on edge. The intricate, layered screenplay, co-written by Bong, delves into the growing divide between the rich and the poor, examining the absurdities and brutal realities of class conflict in modern society. The performances are outstanding, with each member of the Kim and Park families playing their roles to perfection. Song Kang-ho, a frequent collaborator with Bong, delivers a standout performance as Kim Ki-taek, the patriarch of the Kim family. His portrayal of a man both desperate and cunning, trapped in a cycle of poverty, is poignant and powerful. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is another highlight, with the stark contrast between the cramped, dingy basement where the Kim family lives and the sleek, modern luxury of the Park family's home visually reinforcing the class divide. The design of the Park house, with its large windows and clean lines, plays a crucial role in building suspense and tension as the story unfolds. *Parasite* is full of symbolism and metaphors, from the ""staircases"" that represent social hierarchy to the basement that becomes a literal underworld of hidden secrets. The film's title itself reflects the parasitic relationship between the families, as each feeds off the other in different ways, but also comments on the broader systemic inequalities in society. The film's climactic twist and its devastating final act are shocking and leave a lasting impression. Bong Joon-ho skillfully combines moments of brutal violence with emotional depth, creating a conclusion that is as tragic as it is thought-provoking. Overall, *Parasite* is a near-perfect film that transcends genre and cultural barriers. It is a searing critique of inequality, told with biting wit, suspense, and a remarkable attention to detail."

On one side is a cold and hard gymnasium, on the other side is a luxurious and soft back garden. Money is an iron that irons everything flat. They use the free Internet, live in the basement, and do whatever it takes to get a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst, there are worse ones. If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you; if you are poor, there must be someone poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls, dividing people into different levels. This wall stands firm in the wind, sun and rain, and does not move at all. The Park couple looks stupid, but they are getting richer and richer; Kim Ki-taek's family is smart, but they still can't turn over. You think you can get rid of your poor identity by finding a good job and having a good salary, but in fact you are still a long way away. You can wash off the sweat smell on your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that has been integrated into your blood. You climbed ten or twenty floors, and you may just reach someone else's basement. They are bugs, so they have a hard life; they are bugs, so nothing can kill them."

His latest film, Parasite, gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make. All unemployed, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident. Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon-ho, his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn't see coming at all. It's a brilliantly written film, the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking. There's a real intricacy to the screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard-hitting. It isn't just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy, the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold. The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park's family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze-like features almost serving as a character itself. Hong Kyung-pyo's sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower-class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin-mo's score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess. Coming to the performances, Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season. It's very much an ensemble piece, each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand-outs for me were Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Cho Yeo-jeong. Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to. I haven't been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it's going to get better with each viewing."

Stark warning of the manipulativeness of the have nots!,2024-04-12,imdb,"Absolute cinematic masterpiece!! I felt thrust into a world exposing me to areas blurring the lines between the privileged and the marginalized. It's brilliance lies not only in its storytelling but also in its unapologetic portrayal of the lengths individuals will go to climb the social ladder. As we explore the complexities of ""Parasite,"" a chilling realization emerges: the true parasites are not the wealthy elite but rather those who lurk in the shadows, preying on the unsuspecting. The Kim family's deception serves as a stark warning of the dangers posed by those at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder, whose desperation drives them to resort to deceit and manipulation in pursuit of their ambitions. Through its portrayal of the Kims' Machiavellian machinations, ""Parasite"" issues a sobering admonition to beware of the wolves in sheep's clothing lurking within our midst. The film serves as a cautionary tale, reminding audiences that privilege is not just a matter of wealth but also of naivety and vulnerability. In a world where appearances can be deceiving and trust is a scarce commodity, ""Parasite"" forces us to confront the uncomfortable truth that sometimes the greatest threats come from those closest to us. ""Parasite"" challenges conventional notions of morality and justice, presenting a provocative exploration of power dynamics and social stratification. By casting the Kim family as both protagonists and antagonists, the film subverts traditional narratives, offering a fresh perspective on the complexities of human nature. As we grapple with the implications of ""Parasite,"" its impact transcends the realm of cinema, prompting us to question our assumptions and prejudices in the face of an uncertain world."

Also, the symbolization on the smell in the movie was really great. A poor family could fix everything, make adjustments, and live a false life. But he couldn't get rid of that smell. It was the smell of the place where he lived. What they couldn't get rid of was this smell... The name of the movie could even be the smell, really! Because from my point of view, the most memorable part of the movie, that's what it was... When I was reading reviews about the film before, I personally thought that this rich family would be broken up when I heard the concept of ""family falling apart"". They will defraud the family and pull them to their side, etc. But the family that really fell apart was both... And there have been those who have said that there are no facial expressions for Koreans or something, I never agree with this. Because they are very special people who pass that feeling to us even with their eyes, their looks... The fact that they do not have obvious lines like us does not make them a failure in the acting sense. Korea is in a really great place in the TV and movie industry. I would also recommend other movies and TV series. It is especially useful to take a look at the Hong brothers' series. When I saw Park Seo Joon at the beginning of the movie, I thought it would continue in the movie, but then I saw that he wasn't in the movie anymore, but he was the one who started the events -albeit indirectly... Betrayal, fraud, rich-poor conflict, the most obvious and soft facts.. These were all the thoughts that lay at the heart of ""parasite""."

The second half is like really weird though but I enjoyed it. Does it deserve all the praise it gets? Honestly I'd say yes.

The film is about two families living in vastly different classes, who interact with each other in a very peculiar way. The Kim's are a poor family living in South Korea, finding any feasible way to earn enough money to get by life. The Kim's find multiple ways to work for a wealthy family, The Parks, by being housekeepers, tutors, and drivers by intentionally getting the previous workers fired through malicious acts. Through the film we come to learn that their plans of overtaking all the previous workers' positions begin to introduce complications which later leads to total chaos. I believe that this film is one of the most meaningful and most intricate films ever made. Ranging from Writing and Cinematography to the Topics covered, this film does not fail to capture every emotion intended to be displayed by the director. The theme about class in the film is very present and gives a deeper dive into how classism can affect both ends of the spectrum of class. There is also another theme about how people will use other people for their own advantage, thus the name Parasite. I will be focusing on the writing and cinematography in the film to evaluate how this film perfects ambience, mood, and the meaning of the film. The screen writing in Parasite really helps capture the mood and tone of the movie. In the beginning of the film, we are presented with an almost comedy-like movie, where the characters are being introduced but we get a good understanding of what the characters are going through. For example, we are introduced to the Kim's which are struggling to make a living and we learn about their struggles with money and finding work, in almost an unserious way. It makes the viewer feel disconnected with their struggles. I believe the way this is presented is on purpose for the fact that we only want to be introduced to the characters, and not grow a relationship with them. Later in the movie, once we see the plans of the Kim's start to fail, we are shifted into a more serious and dark tone. It is remarkably interesting how we can go from not feeling a connection to the characters in the beginning, to feeling like we are involved in the demise of the Kim's. This switch up in emotions is possible, due to the screenwriting as well as the Cinematography. The cinematography really captures everything the writing was not able to fully express."

One side is the cold and hard gymnasium, and the other side is the luxurious and soft back garden. Money is an iron that irons everything. They scrape the net, live in the basement, and do anything for a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the film suddenly reverses: they are not the most miserable, there are more miserable. If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you; If you are poor, there must be someone poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls, dividing people into three, six, nine, etc. This wall, even in the wind, sun and rain, stands still. The Park and his wife look silly, but they are still getting richer; The Jinjize family is smart, but they still can't turn around. You think that if you find a good job and get a good salary, you can get rid of your poverty status. In fact, it is still a thousand miles away. You can wash away the sweat smell of clothes, but you can't wash away the smell of basement that has been integrated into blood. You have climbed ten or twenty floors, and may have just reached someone else's basement. They are worms, so they live hard; They are worms, so nothing can kill them."

This South Korean film cleverly intertwines dark humor, drama, and social commentary, creating a cinematic experience that is as uniquely compelling as it is thought-provoking. The narrative revolves around the Kim family, who, struggling to make ends meet in their semi-basement home, find themselves devising a cunning plan to infiltrate the lives of the wealthy Park family. What starts as a seemingly straightforward tale of class struggle rapidly morphs into a layered exploration of inequality, privilege, and the lengths one will go to for survival. Bong's direction is nothing short of genius. He crafts a film that keeps you on the edge of your seat, continuously defying expectations. The cinematography is striking, utilizing the contrasting settings of the Kims' cramped, dilapidated quarters and the Parks' opulent dwelling to symbolize the vast chasm between the two families. Each scene is meticulously framed, capturing the essence of the characters' circumstances and their emotional states. The performances are sublime, with each actor delivering a nuanced portrayal that adds depth to the narrative. Song Kang-ho as Kim Ki-taek epitomizes desperation and resilience, while Cho Yeo-jeong as Yeon-kyo brings a naive charm to a matriarch unaware of the deception unfolding around her. Their interactions are imbued with a palpable tension, making viewers question the morality of each character's choices. What truly sets ""Parasite"" apart is its ability to oscillate between genres, seamlessly transitioning from drama to thriller to all-out chaos. It keeps audiences guessing, often eliciting gasps and laughter in equal measure. The film's climax is nothing short of a masterstroke, serving as a sharp indictment of social hierarchy while delivering a chilling reminder of the consequences of unchecked ambition and hunger. In addition to its gripping narrative, ""Parasite"" leaves viewers with lingering questions about society's structure. It serves as a mirror reflecting the disparities that plague our world, urging us to confront uncomfortable realities. It challenges the audience to identify with both the oppressor and the oppressed, blurring moral lines in a way that is both unsettling and enlightening. ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that invites dialogue and introspection."

The most important reason that makes the film Parasite admirable at first glance is the way Bong Jung Ho looks at the poor family in the film. Something like the look Koreida had in the movie Shoplifters. Depicting people who, although they live in the basement, although they are poor and do not have proper jobs, but they are by no means lost and hopeless people. The basic question that is ironically expressed in the film is why a family with such intelligence is so poor and their place is underground?"

They live in poverty in a "" banjiha"" or basement apartment. One day a family friend comes to say his goodbyes. He's going to college abroad and suggests that the son of the family should apply for his job of tutoring the oldest girl in the wealthy Park family. He tells the son that he has the knowledge, just not the credentials, and says that he will personally recommend him to the Parks. The girl in the Kim family helps create fake printed credentials for her brother via software that the Parks never question. The son is hired, and the son then works on getting the other three members of his family hired by the Parks. First, the daughter is hired as an ""art therapist"" for the Parks' rather complex son, Da Song. The hiring of the parents, however, takes more work. That requires getting the current chauffeur and housekeeper fired by making the Parks believe something about each that is not true. Realize that the Parks don't tell either the chauffeur or the housekeeper why they've been fired, because they hate confrontation. Also know that the Parks have no idea that their four new employees are related to each other. So the Kims are on easy street until the old housekeeper shows up while the Parks are away, saying that she needs to get in the basement because she left something behind. What she left behind sets off the second half of the film You might say that the first half plays like a light comedy, like a film about some light grifting , but that the second half is a very dark comedy. So everybody here has both sympathetic and unlikeable qualities. All are parasites in some sense of the word. The rich family - the Parks - aren't bad people. However, they have little empathy. They look down on their servants, and they can be cruel because they don't like inconvenience and confrontation. To investigate what was going on with the servants they so casually fired would mean confrontation. So they just give generous severance to ease their minds. The poor family -the Kims - are smart, resourceful, and they are willing to work hard. And yet they are poor. The movie shows that if you are at the bottom, it's difficult to escape poverty without faking it and without being ruthless, even being ruthless to other poor people. The 'smell' of poverty will keep you back. The title does have a meaning. Everybody in the movie is sucking the life out of other people."

If you're gonna put sex in movies, you need to have a good reason. This movie didn't have a good reason. That scene where the Kim family was hiding in the shadows while the Parks were on the couch watching their kid and engaging in sexual behavior, was not necessary, at least the sexual behavior was not necessary. This would've been a perfect movie without that. I'm the kind of person who doesn't like that content in movies and seeing that scene in this movie almost ruined it. This movie was one of a kind, it was so good, but that one scene with the Parks, did not need to happen. And that is why I rated 9/10."

I have now had the chance to see the film and this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a poor family look to gain an opportunity by gaining jobs in a higher class family and gain the advantages from that. Main Character Now there are quite a few characters in this film but really Woo-Sik Choi plays the son in the family and he does a great job in the film, you can see he has pretty honest intentions at first but things start to unravel for him and he doesn't quite know what to do. He is likeable but you aren't sure if you should root for him and that creates a multi layered character that keeps you interested throughout. Supporting Characters Everybody gives a superb performance in the film, I won't go through everybody's names as they are quite long but whether it is the poor family or the rich family everybody is believeable and real in the film. These characters are as mentioned before multi layered and you just aren't exactly sure who exactly to root for. The one actor I will mention is Kang-Ho Song as the Father of the poor family, he is truly brilliant in this film, he probably goes through the most in this film and he is the most interesting person in this film and honestly he should have probably got nominated for the Best Supporting Actor at The Oscars but nonetheless he is great in this film. Story The first 20 minutes of this film I wasn't exactly sure where this film was going but it is super fascinating watching the dynamics between the two families and seeing the different personalities and motivations which really blurs the line. I don't want to go into the plot too much as I had no idea what this film was about before I watched it so it should be the same for you. Also to put it on top the ending for this movie is so thought provoking and perfect for the film that has been going on. Script The script even though in Korean is brilliant, this film suprisingly has tons of humour in it, I laughed quite a bit in this film which shows just how well the writing is to make these characters feel multi dimensional. The drama also really works to make you truly care about what is going on and what is happening to the characters that you are watching."

That is not new. But this film reaches new heights, not through more extravagant plot but through a more naturalistic approach. As a result, the comedy, the stakes, and the insights here are at a different level. You care about the protagonists, and you feel the weight of their struggle. All the same ingredients are there (the social satire, the violence, the bizarre twists, the brilliant direction), but there's a new weight to this film. I don't think ""masterpiece"" is too strong, and I'm looking forward to watching it again some time soon."

There is clearly no surprise that it won 4 Academy Awards. My favorite part of the film was 100% the cinemaphotography, this movie is art, and that's thanks to the cinemaphotography. Every angle isn´t lazy. It´s well made and the director Bong Joon Ho took every chance possible to put his vision on the big screen. Another amazing thing is the acting. The actors put the best performance possible. From dramatic scenes, to intense scenes and to horror scenes. Now some people might not like the ending, but it had me amazed. It shows also how unpredictable this film is. It also shows how everyone isn´t who they say they are. Even if its just small things. This film is amazing and if you haven´t seen it, then I highly recommend it. (unless you cant handle violence) if not, then watch it."

One day a friend of Ki-woo, the son, tells him of a job opportunity; the wealthy Park family need an English tutor for their teenaged daughter. Equipped with forged qualifications he gets the job, not only that he suggests that his sister, Ki-jung, who he introduces as a cousin of a friend would be the ideal art tutor for their son. It isn't long before Father, Ki-taek, and mother, Chung-sook, are also employed as driver and housekeeper... all this is done in a way that doesn't give away that they know each other. Things are looking up for the Kims as they enjoy their new situation; then the old house keeper, who they got fired, returns and their new success is threatened in a surprising way. This film is hard to pigeonhole; it is a comedy that provides plenty of laughs; it is a social commentary of the vast difference in wealth in Korean society; it toys with horror tropes; there is some romance; and has violent moments. It could have turned out to be a real mess but the elements blend together almost perfectly. The cast does a really fine job making the characters believable even when the situation is far-fetched. For the most part it is set within the Park's large, modern house; the only other location of note it the contrastingly small basement flat the Kim's call home... the comparison emphasises who different the families' circumstances are. The story provides some twists, which I won't spoil here; these often lead to a shift in tone... even when things turn darker in tone there are still laughs to be had. Director Bong Joon-ho, who also co-wrote the story, does a great job as the film treads the fine line between brilliance and silliness... always keeping on just the right side. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something a little different. These comments are based on watching the film in Korean with English subtitles."

The rich or the poor.,2021-10-05,imdb,"A foreign film that won four Oscars is unheard of. In 2020, the film Parasite directed by Bong Joon-Ho won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best International Feature Film. During this time many Asians and Asian-American people were facing a lot of racism because of Covid and much other generational racism, therefore it was a very BIG deal that a foreign film that was all in Korean with an all-Korean cast was winning Oscars back-to-back. It was a tremendous accomplishment, especially considering the Academy Awards have been chastised for being racially biased against persons of color and for failing to recognize Asian actors. Parasite is set in a modern-day society in the city of Seoul, the film shows the dark reality of societal structures. The Park family, a working-class family cunning their way into the Kim home. The Kim family, a wealthy family, clinging to the working class by living comfortably off the backs of their labor. The movie Parasite critiques societal class and shows us how two classes can co-exist but never interact. The stairs, which depict how the Parks and the Kims are separated and show the double meaning of societal class distinction, are one of the primary symbols in the movie Parasite. The depiction of stairs in this film is quite repetitive; there are stairs in practically every scene, especially as the plot begins. For instance, to go into the Parks' house, you must descend the stairs, while to get into the Kims' home, you must ascend the steps. To illustrate, there's a scene where there's a rainstorm and the Parks have to hurry from the Kims' house to theirs because it's flooding, and we can see how far the Parks reside from the Kims at this point. The cameras are filming the Parks as they descend the steps that lead to their neighborhood. Every scene shot during this period depicts the Parks going down the stairs, which represents their stance in societal class. The rain was a curse for the Parks, but a blessing for the Kims, who found the rain to be beautiful and allowed for the sky to be blue and clear the next morning. I appreciated how Bong Joon-Ho took his time to outline the symbolism of the stairs and show how two different families viewed the rainstorm. It gives the rich-poor divide a whole new level of significance."

We have a good photograph, we have Oscar-worthy performances, a breathtaking suspense, with heavy scenes, like falling down the stairs and stoned on the head , sometimes with some comic relief but nothing compares to the script and direction. In a current cinematographic world without originality we see a parasite, which we see a father of the family ki taek ( song kang ho ) unemployed killing a parasitic insect , which we can think of as if it were a spoiler from the end, but in reality he and his family end up playing this role, deceiving and lying in order to suck financial power and gradually take over the upper class family home. With a direction that manages to place all these gender elements mentioned above in a single work in a masterful way , placing more abstract and intriguing motifs ( like the stone carried by the English instructor son, how to place the upper class house on top and when the family ""parasites"" he needs to return to his home in the flood and he descends all the time, as if he were returning to his former social class , with the vomit in a toilet and exploding the water outlet in the other toilet, all with magnificent edition. But nothing compared to the script, exactly everything fits here, all the motives of all the characters , being an upper class family with one child paying more attention than the other for having had a trauma of having seen a ghost, the daughter alone , and sad that he has an emotional need being taken advantage of by the son of the parasitic family instructor of English who takes the opportunity to integrate his whole family with functions as a driver, housekeeper and arts instructor ... we see that there were parasites in the family, they just stayed and switched places ...

It is a social commentary on how the rich are ignorant of the struggles of poor people, leeching off of them without considering the negative effects it has on them. This element of the story was displayed in a unique and disturbing way that escalated in the shocking and bloody climax. Unfortunately, this film in my opinion wasn't as groundbreaking and masterful as the critics said it was. It winked at the revenant issues in society without instigating change. None of the people in the movie who were victims of this evil cycle did anything about their predicament to start helping others (The rich) and get out of their situation by accessible community college means (The poor). Despite the critic hype and intelligently displayed class war at the heart of the story, it felt as if it used the same rinsed and recycled props, sub-plots, downfalls, cliches, and unfortunate endings to display an ongoing problem in our society that has yet to be changed. This movie isn't really asking for change, it is just putting people against each other, still oblivious to the situation, rather then showing activism and improving the welfare of others."

Its like nothing else before, its not only a comedy, its also a horror, drama and a thriller with a great message behind it. The acting is good i feel, but of course i cant tell perfectly because i dont understand Korean. The reason this movie is good is because of its spontaneous and ambiguity. Film writters often do films where they answer all the question in your asking yourself about the story. But in those case, you watch the movie and you dont really think about it afterwards because often those answer are boring or too simple. But in this case, the film is good because it dives into something relatively ordinary but always make you wonder if there is something more to it. The way the events occur are nothing like any other movie. It has a marvelous ending with full of sense. I really like the way the director portrays the simple emotions of life and the class of society. If you are open to new ideas and new way of looking at a story you may like Parasite."

For those who don't know, the film released in 2019 to immediate acclaim, winning several awards, and for good reason. The plot follows a poor family and a rich family in Korea. The poor family live underground in a tiny apartment sized home, with little food and luxuries. On the other hand, the richer family lives in a beautiful, futuristic home that looks like something out of a Stanley Kubrick film like ""A Clockwork Orange"" due to its intriguing architecture and design. Anyway, the son in the poor family receives a request from a friend to work at the rich family home. He agrees, and as the story goes on, the poor family forges a plan to purposely eliminate and fire every other worker at the house to be the exclusive workers. Their plan works, in a wacky and comical way. However, it becomes more of a thriller and even horror once the house's basement is revealed to have a man hiding within, the husband of one of the previous workers. It begins to go downhill, and that's when the film peaks and became one of my all time favorites. Overall, it is a must watch for any movie fan or student! 10/10."

The naretive and the actors were excellent . Parasite has made me think more than most films i have seen. They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and upper class. You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be greatful about it too! Give it watch , see it with friends or family Members... you'll enjoy this movie a lot."

Who is the parasite? This movie is absurdly great, it gets you by the balls and makes you feel everything they planned you too feel. True poetry does this. It guides you to explain exactly what you need to understand, both logically and sentimentally. This was written by a true artist that not only understands the topic at hand but has a deep knowledge about the medium and visual language. Parasite takes you to another reality, it is raw and yet it hides its rawness through comedy, masticated just enough so you can feel comfortable at first. This is exactly how society is, you are in your home, sitting on a chair or lying in your bed, reading this comment on your thousand dollar computer of phone, full belly, warm, relaxed. The comedy gets you instantly. Light, easy to grasp, easy to follow along. And then, when it hits you, it hits hard, it hits where it matters. The movie prepares you, hints you where it is going to hit, but you are NOT READY. You receive these hints every day, every time. You walk on the streets, you see it, you ignore it. You ignore people, you ignore hunger, poverty, death. Yet, it is all there. Suffering never stops. Never. And yet, you try to be comfortable, you struggle to find behaviors in you that can clear your ego. You protect yourself and hide yourself from reality, consume large amounts of soft sweet warm media, consult with top-notch psychologists, have pets, great food, great internet, great movies, great distractions. This movie is about this, you, us, our distractions. It is a conversation that needs to happen and for this reason I recommend you stop everything now and watch this movie. Thanks."

It is equally parts darkly humorous, thought provoking, relatable, and frightening. The first half of the film plays out like a wickedly diabolical black comedy. As the cunning, yet relatable underclass Kim family deviously schemes to infiltrate the much wealthier and more fortunate Park family. The kim family's deceitful schemes are portrayed as slightly mean spirited but also deeply relatable. We understand why the Kim family is doing what they are doing. Their situation is horrible. They live in a claustrophobic, bug infested, dirty house and (despite being hard working and intelligent) barely make enough money to make ends meet. Yet, the film somehow never feels as if it is openly supporting what the family is doing. The awful and desperate nature of the kim family's lives, (along with how it contrasts with the much more lavish, carefree life of the Park family) is brilliantly conveyed through the film's masterful cinematography. The camerawork and lighting is at times surreally beautiful and at other times horribly uncomfortable to look at. You feel the claustraphobia and discomfort that the Kim family must endure in their own home everyday of their lives and their desperate longing to experience a fleeting glimpse of the life of comfort that the Park's live. As a result, though you do not necessarily agree with the actions of the Kims, it is easy to delight in their perverse exploitation of the rich and powerful. This is rather obviously where most of the film's memorable comedy derives from. Delivered through a witty and cleverly written script, the comedic side of the film is incredibly entertaining and becomes even more so on repeat viewings due to the more subtle aspects of it. This rather light hearted and satirical tone completely changes in the film's second and third acts through the introduction of a shocking, riveting, and complex plot twist that makes you question everything you found delightful about the first act. The film is very suspenseful, intense and morally gray in this second half. You genuinely have no idea which characters are in the right or wrong, and the tension continues building until the film's hauntingly dreadful conclusion. Overall, Parasite is an incredible film in every aspect. The acting is exceptional across the board with every actor turning in relatable and undeniably human preformances."

Even on second viewing, there isn't a single boring minute. The tale captures you from the very beginning and makes you feel heavily invested in the story right away. The first hour is gleefully entertaining, showing the poor family put on a scam scheme. When you see it unfolds, it just leaves you with a smile on your face and laughing along with their execution. And this uplifting charm helps so much more for the impact of the second half of the movie. Not getting into spoilers, but this build up is well worth it. Overall the movie is simply a viewing pleasure. Great acting, excellent story and cinematography filled with symbolism. An irreverent tale of class differences I would highly recommend anyone to give it a watch."

The storyline involves a family down on their luck and funds when they find an opportunity they can't pass up. They've been asked to house sit for a wealthy family while on vacation and have strict rules on how they need to take care of the house. Each member of the family lies to the wealthy family and takes a role within their household. When the family comes back from their trip early, the working family needs to work really hard to hide their scheming ways; unfortunately for them, there may be secrets going on all around them they could have never anticipated. This movie is directed by Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer) and stars Kang-ho Song (The Host), Sun-kyun Lee (A Hard Day), Yeo-jeong Cho (The Concubine) and Woo-sik Choi (Train to Busan).

Even some of the 4 and 5 star reviews makes it clear these people did not watch this film or partially watched it with one eye on their Instagram feed or simply don't know what they're talking about. Well, it won Best Picture of the Year at the Oscar's becoming the first foreign film to accomplish that, and well deserved. So much for the few low reviews. This movie is a rare moment in modern cinema considering how bad movies have been in recent years coming out of Hollywood. South Korea may singlehandedly save American cinema by reminding them how to make a spectacular movie. Let me be clear, it's the best movie of the last decade. Period.

The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that. The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen.

This wouldn't work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script. The second half was where the themes became apparently clear. The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society. Through the conversations, we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes, and how fed up one can feel. The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle, which made the script even more masterful. Overall, arguably Bong Joon-Ho's best work. 9.5/10."

Parasite was clearly made by someone who loves cinema and puts a lot of thought into shaping characters and plot. The first half of this film is as close to perfection as anything I've ever seen. We are introduced to the very human, relatable Kim family, forced to hustle due to their extremely limited means. The steal wifi and fold pizza boxes for money. And then they get a foot in the door to gain various types of employment from a wealthy family who need an English tutor. I won't spoil the plot any more than that, but this film buzzes along from one exciting and interesting event to the next in a way that's logical, humurous, compelling and occasionally dark. The first hour or so is the set up, and the second half of the film is a murky thriller that borders on horror. Some people find fault with the second half of the film and I will say it has some very minor issues with shifts in pacing and some slightly abrupt exposition (EDIT: just watched it a second time and the pacing in the second half is fine - I just didn't take it all in well the first time around) but these are minor quibbles and not enough for me to deduct a point. The film had such a likable, warm centre that I simply don't want to take away from it. In terms of meaning, I saw Parasite as being about the extreme difficulty of upward social mobility. The son of the family is shown climbing stairs to a higher social station, only to descend them again later on in the rain. The Kims stare up at the world from the window of their semi-basement abode and enjoy better surroundings on a higher level later on but seem destined to return whence they came. It also deals very explicitly with the lack of solidarity between members of the working class during conflict. You get the sense, too, that the movie is saying that being good or bad has little to do with where you land in society. The Kims do bad things but you completely understand why they do them. The rich family they land jobs with, the Parks, actually seem like nice enough people, although they've allowed themselves to become detached, snobby and insulated against the feelings of others. The Parks don't have to hustle and lie because they're already well-shod and well-fed, and the director makes sure you realise this: that people hustle and scheme at times when they're desperate, not because they're terrible."

The contrast between the wealthy family, the Parks, and the poor one, the Kims is well set. Starting from a seemingly classic story of social class it evolves in a great family drama with a great plot twist. I particularly enjoy the bitter sweet aspect of this story. You are at times rooting for the Kims and at other times for the Parks. I'm glad this movie got the Oscar.

I was not expecting a foreign language, occurring in a foreign society would affect me so much. Since engaging with another society far from your culture is rather perplexing especially in a movie But, every element of this movie was so well put together together that dragged the audience from the beginning to the end without a blink. The ending was not maybe what viewers anticipated from the beginning, but it wasn't too far out of sight either. The soundtracks were meticulously composed with a purpose for each scene to convey the emotion that the director wants to the audience. Because Parasite has played with all my emotions from happiness to sorrow throughout the film and the soundtracks along with the actors were exceptional in deliberating this story to us. This movie pictures the extreme gap between the classes in a society. The story begins with a family who is struggling to make ends meet by folding pizza boxes and selling them and live in half of the basement in a very poor neighbourhood. Their son is taking over a friend's job to teach English in a very wealthy house. The family one by one find their way into the wealthy family household by working for them, from cook to chauffeur. The movie started as a comedy then shifts to a thriller, drama and eventually a bit horror. The movie is shedding light on the problems of society that is rarely talked about. It has made me realize there are struggles in the society that we don't see. The working poor and underclass are not right in front of us. We are all living in one place, but they are the ones who have to crumple in half a basement with the very poor living condition. This is a society where one family is thrilled to see the rain and the other is seeking shelter because the overflooded rain has ruined their basement. If you want an eye-opening movie that shows you the brutalities of a capitalist world, then this is the movie for you. It makes you wonder of what else is happening in a society that you have no slightest idea? It gives you insights of rarely discussed struggles in societies that doesn't care much about the poor. I don't want to spoil it more than I did already, but I have deeply been thinking about the effect of society on people. What one might do to reach the top? How much this gap between classes put pressure on lower classes? This movie has brilliantly pictured the answer to these questions."

At one point, the disillusioning sentence is heard from the father: ""500 university graduates apply for a position as a night watchman."" Everything could be so beautiful if the poor family's greed wasn't so great and their recklessness. They soon discover that the old housekeeper whom they had pushed out of their position has a dangerous secret that could endanger their new positions. This triggers a chain of surreal, mad and wonderful situations that lead to the poor family losing everything and more. But against the background of the madness of the rich family and their airs, all the sins of the poor family were finally excusable. It fills me with sadness that the poor, without rights always remain the poor and without rights, and with every attempt to change their fate they just slide deeper into their Schlamassel."

Why did it become the first non-English-language Oscar-winning film? Why is it ideologically universal and international? The poor slaves of North Korea evoke sympathy. The poor of South Korea at first - too. Until impunity and the prosperity that fell on their heads made them pigs, monsters, parasites that can't stop from greed. But what spoils their ""raspberry""? A sudden spark of sympathy that had been awakened in the new housekeeper's heart for the old, drenched, ill, and undeservedly turned out of the house and work - for the ex-housekeeper who had come to feed her husband. He lives in complete isolation, in prison-like the North Koreans, but, temporarily gaining the upper hand, they begin to mock the exposed family and, at the same time, Kim Jong-Un. Or the moment when the driver (for some reason?) he kills his master and the young entrepreneur just before he dies suddenly says: ""I recognized you!» (that's why!). North and South Koreans - both rich and poor-suddenly become so similar! What's it? National Korean mentality? Unlikely. So you think: the USSR and modern Russia, slave-owning America and modern superpower, Nazi Germany and the modern locomotive of the European Union-are they not mirror images? In the sense that on the other side of the mirror glass - they are the same, simply inverted. Money didn't make rich people happy. They become indifferent and blind to someone else's misfortune, but turn into such blind suckers that it is easy to trick them around your finger. Family values (""banana"" for a hungry husband) are beautiful, but their absolutization makes people sectarian, shackles them with a series of crimes in the yoke of circular bail. In the age of technology, miracles happen when you suspect that all the teachers (a couple of phrases in English and OK), doctors (who put on a white coat becomes the doctor), lawyers (observe the formalities and enjoy yourself) + photoshop, arrogance and skill - all these professionals are just as fake as, for example, a housewife (I don't know what it is - I'll cook it according to the instructions on the label), not to mention art therapists (surf the Internet and that'll do), coaches, psychologists and other shamans. Everyone plays, lies, pretends to believe, or wants to believe, but everyone follows the rules of the game."

Where powerful social satire meets tragedy. The director did a great job portraying South Korea's current views on society exposing the underprivileged slums of most modern cities and it's citizens living in completely different worlds despite staying in close proximity. You are likely to find it relatable as the themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, but all over the world. Having its fair share of global capitalism and universal materialism, Meritocracy being the biggest trope of this movie. Now, the best way to enjoy this film is to cluelessly get into it, its charm is to watch it progress and unfold in many satisfying, unexpected ways. You can definitely see a unique directorial vision as Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy drama, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. It is one of the hardest things to pull off but the director converts them smoothly without letting the audience feel indifferent to the transformation. It manages to elicit the full range of responses, making the viewer react with uneasy laughter to unexpected situations that eventually lead to disturbing events full of horror. Now, who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor? Satirically, it managed to portray how we may live under the same skies, but have different views regarding life. -- ""You know what kind of plan never fails? No plan. No plan at all. You know why? Because life cannot be planned."" Success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it, those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, but for those who cannot escape their sad reality will ultimately turn for the worse and thus start to justify their immoral backstabbing, deceit, and callousness for reasoning that can be only explained by growing up poor without support from others. The characters all have different aspects to them that will be received and viewed differently due to the viewers own biases and world views. This isn't a bad thing as the movies main point is to deliver a provocative social commentary in various metaphors. And the best way to do so is to create morally questionable characters that will resemble at least one familiar person known to you."

It's also the highest-rated film on Letterboxd. Indeed, no matter the source, I had only heard great things about it and to say that my expectations were high, would be an understatement. Thankfully though, despite the popularity of Parasite, I had no idea what it was about. I knew, of course, that it was about the divide between the rich and the poor. However, as far as the plot or any significant moments went, I was clueless. As such, I want to start by talking about how unpredictable this film is and how drastically it changes tone when it needs to. While there seems to be significance in every moment and every shot, there were four moments that particularly stood out to me, or should I say four periods. The first, and most obvious one, is the beginning. Those moments where we get to know Kim Ki-taek and his family. Those early moments of happiness despite struggle and despair. A family that, if nothing else, had each other. Those early moments were filled with a sense of longingness and intimacy, simplicity and even to a certain extent, hope. The first tonal shift, and the beginning and what I would consider the second period, comes as Ki-woo, the son of the family, gets a job tutoring the daughter of rich parents. What follows is a period of deceit and urgency. Those previous tones are forgotten as they lay a path for a fast-paced, comedic period that promises a better life, despite the dangers associated. As the family starts to settle into their new roles, and as their lives start to change, the sense of despair turns into one of greed and ruthlessness. While the first and second period were often humorous and light-hearted, the two last ones are the opposite. The second shift in tone and the start of the third period comes as the family learns of a hidden truth inside the house they now inhabit without permission. This is perhaps the most significant shift in tone, as it not only introduces a certain level of violence, but it also blurs the line between good and evil even further. It's also the first time where, despite how Kim Ki-taek and his family hope to see themselves, they have become what they once despised. They have turned from those looked down upon, to those who look others down. With this change in roles and tone, the film increases in tension and leaves a sense of uncertainty in the air. A sense that won't go away until the fourth, and final, period."

I can't believe it went down like that. BUT I LIKED IT!"" And that's exactly how this movie made me feel. There are a few great movies that don't get the recognition they deserve but I'm glad that this one did. Not only is it a brilliant but MOST IMPORTANTLY a UNIQUE story, which I feel that nowadays is pretty hard to find a movie with these two important concepts. Director Bong Joon-ho not only created a brilliant story, but also did an amazing work flushing out every single character in this film. I had the privilege of going in completely blind, in other words not knowing a single thing about this movie when I saw it for the first time. I didn't know what the film was was about, ( which the trailer did a good job of not spoiling ) I didn't know who the director was ( which I later found out that it was the same director who made 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer', which are movies that I personally enjoyed watching ) I didn't know any of the actors ( which I think that they did an amazing job with their acting in this film, but I did know who the actor Kang-Ho Song was, seeing him in many other well known movies such as 'The Host' and 'The Drug KIng' ). I think that Bong Joon-ho did an amazing work with the cinematography and visual storytelling in this film. I cannot put every single emotion that this movie made me feel into words. I am happy that this movie did well at the box office, I'm also happy that it has become a universal classic and deserves every praise it gets! GO WATCH IT IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT. IT'S A MUST WATCH!"

On first watch, my first watch for me it seemed like an okay movie that seemed messy. On second watch, I thought it was a good movie that had a mediocre script. And on third watch, I thought that it was a really good movie with a decent story. But on fourth watch, I finally understood the hype. Parasite is not only my favorite movie of all time, but I would bet that it is practically flawless. I think it should be up there with the top 10 films of all time. There's the obvious proof of Parasite's excellence with the Oscars for Best Original Screenplay, Best International Feature, Best Director, and Best Picture. But I promise this film is much more than a typical Oscar film. It is complex and fun movie that has one of the best screenplays ever written and I'd argue the best direction of any film I've ever seen. Granted, I haven't seen Citizen Kane or The Godfather. If you are someone who appreciates or likes the Oscars, it is an absolute must watch. And if you don't care about the Oscars or awards season, I highly recommend it."

The first act may seem slow, but then the narrative develops in a very original and believable way, the script does not just develop a few things, everything has a convincing explanation. The film deals with issues of contempt for different social classes, and since the upper social class is not at all interested in the problems of others, they only live in their bubble while the world falls apart, this is portrayed in a crude and realistic way, by showing different representations of this. The character development is extensive, the acting is good, the editing is good, and the third act is very shocking and unexpected. It deserves all the awards it won, it is a very good film that is worthwhile and has a lot of quality, with a well-executed original concept it manages to captivate the public's attention all the time."

The first hours of the movie does a great job establishing all the characters, making you care for them. The second hour of the movie, is where things go crazy.

But was still unsure, you see the thing is I was rooting for 1917 to sweep and was wondering what this parasite film actually was. I watched the trailer and didn't quiet get it. But I decided to give it a go anyway. After sitting through its 2h 8m runtime I couldn't disguise my satisfaction. The movie was one of the best I'd seen from recent years. I will say don't let the subtitles put you off experiencing this masterpiece. The twist came completely out of the blue but did not in any way feel cheap or unearned. In fact the felt extremely consistent with the story whilst still changing the plots destination As for the oscars do I feel that parasite should have seeped? No. Sure I think that best picture, best foreign language film and production design (parasite actually didn't win production design but I think it should have) However I think Sam mendes should have one Director, rian Johnson should have won original screenplay but I'm not so mad anymore. Overall watch parasite and prepare to be amazed"

Bong's original screenplay is one of the freshest and most original ideas I've ever seen/heard of. The idea of a poor family leeching off of a rich family by pretending to be qualified is brilliant. There truly has not been any other film like parasite and I think it should be appreciated as such. The characters and dialogue throughout the film strike as very realistic which is why everything that happens during the flick strikes the viewers very hard. The ending left me in a very depressed state and changed my view of the world a bit. It helped me realize of privilege and how the world just isn't that great. Upon thinking about the film later, I also wondered what the movie would've been like in the Kims' perspective. I believe this movie is one of the greatest ever made, and is an instant classic"

The plot of the film is also one where you wouldn't necessarily think it would appeal to the Academy: a poor family of four living in the underground struggles to survive. When the son gets the opportunity to work for a very wealthy family, their situation suddenly turns around. As a result, events turn upside down. Contrary to other mainstream films, in which the main - supporting scheme is usually clearly followed through, in Parasite the entire cast shines at the same high level. All of them act in absolute top form and give their so different characters that certain something. If you had to pick a stand out, it would be Kim Ki-taek as the father of the poor family. His performance is subtle and funny for long stretches, but once he comes out of his shell, he impresses with a lot of wisdom and unpredictability. But the real hero of the film is director Bong Joon Ho. Known in his home country for years as a borderline brilliant filmmaker, he has given Parasite an aura that few could replicate. Not only is the ensemble of actors spot-on, but everything else, from the stirring music to the beautiful set designs and well-chosen dialogue, he has done everything right with this film. Parasite's success should never have come as a big surprise. Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece is one of the most complete films of recent years. Especially the fact that the film initially resembles a comedy and only then lives up to its actual genre of thriller is a unique approach. In parallel, there is also the influence of other genres, such as drama, mystery and even some action. It remains to mention the social criticism that Parasite tries to communicate over its entire 134 minutes. The class differences in South Korea are portrayed very well. Sometimes discreetly, but mostly transparently and very clearly. This is especially thought-provoking when you watch the film repeatedly and become more aware of this fact. Wonderfully acted, grandiose direction and many genres colliding - Parasite is perfect and rightly the best film of 2020!"

It's meticulous in its design, effective in its direction, and enticing in its writing. The struggling Kim family sees an opportunity when the son starts working for the wealthy Park family. Soon, all of them find a way to work within the same household and start living a parasitic life. Their is no arguing against the film's success and quality. A starling watch which incorporates societal divide through an imbalanced class system and utilising primitive methods to target the lack of understanding within humankind, highlighted in the consequences of rich and poor mixing. Ki-woo, a key figure of poverty in the film is seen to work as a tutor at The Parks' home, Joon Ho implemented this into his production because unfortunately it is the only way in which families from two extreme ends of the class spectrum in modern-day South Korea can cross their paths convincingly in their story arc. For non-Korean speakers, the film is possibly even more exciting, its vibrant, fast tone compliments the increasingly intimate storyline and allows the unfolding of the subplot to be extra special. Setting is used by director Bong Joon Ho to further emphasise the contrasting lifestyles on-screen; A small, open street-terrace on a bustling corner of the town centre contrasts greatly to a large, gated mansion, a home built and designed from scratch solely for the film's purpose. Every detail of the blockbuster is well-received by its audience, mesmerised by every characters every move, captivated in what will happen next. Ultimately, 'Parasite' is a 'be careful what you wish for' message. The title itself referenced an infectious agent, which some may suggest refers to the Kim family swarming The Park's for work and benefits, though is it actually alluding to the diseased poor in civilisation who are made to suffer from the capitalistic greed denying them of jobs, education and healthcare. The picture is an illustrated masterpiece, carefully pioneered to demonstrate serious philosophical subjects in a fantastical manner to convey relevant and important philosophies."

Despite the fact the film's plot reflects social inequality, it is presented straightforwardly and simply. Throughout the story, the film asks us to ask questions in our heads. More than that, it is excellent in terms of production. Every point of view, color grading, and sound effects are meaningful and exciting, drawing the audience even deeper into the film. Overall, it's still a fantastic film with a great script. To make it more understandable, the film concerns heavy topics like class and social inequality. The audience can answer the question at the end of the story that the villain of the story is not poor or the rich, but social inequality, which causes people to be villains."

But take a closer look and find that the hypocrisy and indifference of the rich without any flaws is the stone that lies on their family. The family is unaware of a poor man who has lived in his basement for several years, and the last scene is hopeless for the poor, which is the reality of society."

Suspense, comedy, and drama fall short in describing the intersectional and multimodal genre of this on-screen Román a clef. Setting the tone for the 2020's, Parasite is internationally relatable, aesthetically pleasing, and witty - ""we all have a crazy family"" comes to life as more than just a phrase in this two-hour phenomenon of the decade."

The film could perhaps be a bit more lean and mean, and deliver its jeopardy and payoff with more despatch. But it is an enjoyable, elegant, scabrous movie about a mix of servitude and trickery that is an interesting theme in Korean cinema."

TWICE. This film is brilliant. It's funny in the most witty yet realistic way possible. It's deeply tragic. It's terrifying when you least expect it. Parasite leads you to believe that it's one thing, and suddenly transforms into another. It's a complete masterpiece. The tiny details you will find upon a second viewing or the tiniest bit of research will blow you away. The message behind it is clear but not too obvious. A repeat viewing is perhaps even more satisfying than the first, knowing what's THERE before it is revealed is just... a feeling I can't explain. It's a must watch. Not to be missed."

Once I learned about all the layers, I could only conclude that this movie is a masterpiece! I had a class called ""Visual culture"" at my University and this movie would be perfect for the analysis of its visual language.

One of the greatest things about Parasite is its sharp plot. The way that the Kim family plot their scheme and enact their plan is brilliantly devised, and shot in the most extraordinary way. I really liked that the plot didn't bog itself down in the morality of their actions. There was no dithering about from the family and no pause for a discussion of whether what they were doing was right (which I feel an American film would have bogged itself down in). Bong Joon-ho trusted us as an audience to immerse ourselves in the world of the Kim's and just roll with what they doing. The themes of Parasite were also very layered, some more subtle and complex than others, but all intricately connected and well thought out. The messaging throughout the film was so rich that it remained constantly engaging. From the little I knew about this film going in I was expecting a dark thriller, so the comedy took me completely by surprise. Choi Yeon-gyo stole the show for me with her comedic scenes standing out the most, and she was perhaps unlucky not to get greater Academy recognition. I can't sing Bong Joon-ho's praises enough for his direction on Parasite, creating such an eerie atmosphere while also nailing the black comedy. The minimalist design of the house, the bleak colours and tones, all holding their own meanings, really emphasised the messaging of the film and cultivated a constant atmosphere of unease, at times descending into full on horror. After a second viewing/dissection I'm sure I will have more to say, but for now I will simply say that Parasite is a must watch. Intriguing from the get go and spot on with its dark humour, Parasite is sure to pave the way for a greater visibility of eastern cinema in the west."

This cinema does not answer, but masterfully poses all the questions that should be asked. Interestingly enough, just like the characters do in the movie, Bong Joon Ho does not allow the audience a moment to think about the grand theme of the movie until the very end: What went wrong? It's funny, original, thrilling, and universal. It's a movie to watch thoughtlessly with a can of beer. It's a movie you could sit down and study the metaphors for hours. Parasite suggests a new paradigm for understanding our society, and most importantly, the people inside it."

The pacing is also fantastic, it leans in slowly, exactly how you want a thriller to do. By the time you've reached the end of it you feel ""how did I get here"" but at the same time it makes total sense how you got there. The desperation portrayed by the actor's performances is also so genuine. Their acting capabilities are so overlooked too when you factor in all the fantastic elements of this movie.

They steal WiFi from their neighbors, work on minimum wage jobs and live in a basement apartment. Kim Ki-woo's life changes when he gets an offer from his friend to work as an English tutor, because the friend was going to study abroad. The friend is infatuated with the girl and wants his friend be around during his absence to avoid others being around his crush. The young man accepts the offer, changes his name to Kevin and starts tutoring Park Da-hye, who quickly falls in love with ""Kevin"". Once among the Parks, Kevin develops a different plan:he want to get his family into the Park family. Will he succeed to get his poor family into the Parks? If yes, will the Kims, the poor family, become as rich and privileged as the Parks? Parasite, by Bong Joon Ho, is the film of the year. It won the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. Apart from its numerous accolades, Parasite won 4 awards at the 92nd Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best International Feature film. This is the first non-English language film to win Best Picture Award. It won as the Best Foreign Language Film at the 77th Golden Globe Awards. It won the Best Film Not in the English Language and the Best Original Screenplay awards at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. A bell sounds right at the beginning of the film is there to verify if all the speakers of the theater function properly or not. The bell is there to be compared to the plurality of voices a society produces. Like the bell, there are many others symbols in this film that deserve to be studies closely. The food in the film often symbolizes the same notion of ""up and down"". The noodles, the cheaper food, are made for Kim family, while the beef, the expensive one, is for the Parks. The rain in the film plays the same role as the food. It emphasizes the opposite perceptions that individuals from two different social classes have about the same thing and how that same thing influences them differently. Water symbolizes the reality and the stone symbolizes false hopes. Water always goes down and not up and can damage those who live ""down"", the poor. This was the case when the strong rain came and damage the Kims' house. Parasite foreshadowing: the scene, where the fumigation happens, the daughter attempts to close the window, but the father tells not to, because it is a ""free extermination"". Everyone starts coughing, except from the father."

Kim lives with his family with limited facilities where they search for wifi all around the house in opening scene.Park family lives a luxurious life with high paid workers all around them for everything. The best thing is how the director potrays the class division and the relation between families of different extend. Starting as a usual story of struggling family, Parasite navigates through relatable dark humour and ends in emotional note.Conversations between the park couple too show their attitude towards the kim family. Director uses rain to show the difference in situations between the families.Rain is shown as beautiful view of nature in Park's house (nice frames too in park family scenes) and as destructive devil in Kim's house. Director aptly uses objects to connect the story.For instance, After an incident, young kim throws a rock that his friend gifts to bring prosperity to the family.That scene shows the kind of superstitious beliefs still existing within us.Look out for the final Kim father-son conversation scene. Technically,bgm enhances the dark satire aspect and conveys the emotion towards the end.Cuts made sure that viewer isn't detached from the progression of the movie at any point once the plot gets interesting. All just performed excellently except Mrs.Park.Her emotions were a bit over-done . I can't justify the final twist where Mr.Kim kills Mr.Park without clear justification and that sums up the only major drawback after watching the movie. Parasite sums up to be the resultant of the script duo's work in the thin plot and some smart execution that makes sure that viewer forgets to think about the wafer thin plot"

I'm a big ""Avengers - Endgame"" fan, but ""The Irishman"" and especially ""The Lighthouse"" really touched me. And now we have ""Parasite"" by Bong Joon-ho, the South Korean director of ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"". ""Parasite"" was the first South Korean film to win the golden palm at the Cannes Film Festival and garnered tons of good reviews. Recently it also won four Academys, amogst other things of course ""Best Picture"". Logically, I was interested. The Kim family lives on a subsistence level and takes every opportunity to improve their situation. How fitting that one day the son receives an offer to help a wealthy family ... The less you know about ""Parasite"", the better! Nevertheless, I try to rate the film as best as possible without giving anything away. What is the best way to describe ""parasite""? It´s not easy, because the genre of the film alone is not easy to grasp. The film works here and there as a satire, can surprise with some really funny moments, but also has very metaphorical scenes and then suddenly becomes scary and exciting. And that's all an understatement. ""Parasite"" always surprised me. In a moment you suspect you know what kind of film it is, but then there is the first twist and then the next and I was always surprised. Few films can do that. Joon-ho stages a masterful, socially critical film that works on so many levels. The visual level, for example, is fantastic, ""Parasite"" works with grotesque, but nevertheless appropriate exaggerations, which sometimes are difficult to bear in terms of their message and strength. The name of the film gives a wonderful hint of what to expect. All actors are fabulous and deserve the greatest recognition, because it is not just the terrific script or the equally fabulous direction that make ""Parasite"" so effective. I especially liked Song Kang-ho as father of the Kims! Technically, ""Parasite"" offers creative and sometimes breathtaking camera settings. Some spectacular sets were built for the film, such as the Kims' family home. The editing is great and Jeong Jae-il's score was also wonderfully integrated into the visuals; everything just fits here! Conclusion: You have to see ""Parasite""! It is one of those films that certainly offers something for everyone, but at the same time brings with it so much intelligence and strength that I am amazed and happy at the same time that this South Korean work is so well received by the audience."

I deeply cared for the well-being and outcome of all these characters, and found myself taking their perspective and cheering on their misadventures. It's a difficult task to get an American audience to connect with an impoverished Korean family, but Bong Joon-ho does it perfectly. The narrative element is used more to paint a conceptual picture, giving us insight into the ambitions and motives behind the characters. The film takes long winding turns. Viewers who go in expecting an easy watch or a simple lesson are going to get much more than they anticipated. The film also does well to never put itself in a box. At times it is comedic, often thrilling, very dramatic, and sometimes even horrific. It has highlights in all categories of appeal. I have nothing bad to say. This is the first film I've watched where I was sure that every moment was done exactly right."

It feels very familiar even though its Korean and I didn't expect it to be that way. I highly recommend watching.

Huge praise to Song Kang-ho and Park So-dam especially, they gave amazing performances. The cinematography/set design is also impressive and uniquely correlates with the ongoing story. The use of staircase and lines to tackle the ongoing theme, while not subtle, is done extremely well. The soundtrack, while not exactly memorable, manages to elevate the tense atmosphere and keep people on the edge of their seats.

I just can't stop watching this film! No other film has had such a huge impact on me. Everything is just perfect. The story is unpredictable and extremely layered. Every shot has a visual subtext.

IMDb have it listed as a 'Comedy, Drama, Thriller'. These three just don't do it justice. It certainly has some very funny moments ... but it's equally depressing and sad (both in a good way) as it deals with tough subjects like injustice, poverty and class. It certainly is a drama; each character has multiple situations ranging from normality to crisis. We watch as these scenarios merge and cultivate themes and topics to contemplate. Yes, you guessed it ... it's also a thriller; the storytelling beautifully builds up, twists and works to a crescendo. However, the film has so much more. There's plenty of argument to add 'Horror, Romance or Crime' which are all blended into the colourful narrative. Plus, this film is the quintessential 'Family' film; yes, the families are in 'interesting' situations, but the shades develop and raise questions on many layers. The fact this film can do all of this and stay even remotely coherent explains why the film is rare. The credit should go to the sharp writing and directing of Bong Joon Ho and the brave and touching work of the actors. Now ... it's a long way from 'perfect' in my opinion. I've scored this film a 10 here as it just crept into the required range with 91/100 using my own scoring system (I have my own detailed method). It's certainly true that some people won't enjoy this film. Of course, the genre mix I describe above may put people off straight away. Without saying too much that gives anything important away some might feel the underlying themes have been done before and that the film can feel confused and ambiguous (on a variety of subjects and positions). You may also need to deal with a film without an obvious 'hero', characters with whom you may struggle to empathise (especially by the end) and an 'unlikely' main plot and close. Personally, none of these impacted my enjoyment of the movie in a significant way. I'd primarily put this down to the direction, screenplay and acting. There are small moments in the film, which resonate as they underpin the themes. I found 'Parasite' thought provoking and engaging throughout."

Although Parasite (2019) is the first movie of his I got to enjoy, Okja (2017) and Snowpiercer (2013) have been on my watchlist for quite a while. I should seriously consider watching them when I'll have the chance. One of his trademarks is that his films are socially and politically conscious and he displays that strong subject matter while using black humor and bold saturated colors. He's only the second Asian director to win the Oscar for the best director (the other one is Ang Lee for Brokeback Mountain (2005) and Life of Pi (2012)) and the first one of Korean descent to do so, and I want to discuss the success of Parasite and why the movie is highly appreciated by most of the critics. Writing nasty but lovable people isn't an easy task, but Parasite executed this trope perfectly. The movie follows the Kims - a poor family, who makes a living by taking odd jobs, such as folding pizza boxes. Things turn around as the adult son Ki-woo gets recommended as an English tutor for a teenage daughter of an upper-class family, the Parks. That's when the long-con started to take motion - soon after, Ki-woo sets up his sister Ki-jeong as an art tutor for the Parks' youngest son then both of them land their father a job as Mr. Park's chauffeur and their mother a job as the housekeeper, while keeping the fact that they are related a secret to the parks. This mischievous behavior would be fraud during most cases, but over here - you just couldn't help but root for the family as the way they set this whole plan in motion is impressive, to say the least. The other thing this movie managed to accomplish is displaying something that isn't common in popular media. The plot of a low-income family infiltrating an upper-class family is unheard of to me, and this new experience is a part of what made this movie great. Other than that, the other great factor is the way multiple genres, like family, drama, dark comedy, a political thriller, and horror are used here that question us what to expect from this movie and where the plot will lead. The serious major switch in the genre comes as the Kims have successfully infiltrated the home of the Parks and they take advantage of the upper-class family's absence to live in the mansion as if it was their own."

I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements. As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year. The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining. Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching."

I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don't worry, this review won't have any spoilers whatsoever. To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities. A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs. Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie. The plot of this movie is something I've yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming. At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind's strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn't in your face."

Just imagine in a film that combined all these feelings, so I evaluated it with this evaluation, and I told everyone that if the film did not take the OSCArs as the best film, the ceremony would be unfair, but my suspicion was true, and the film only what was said.

I was on the edge of my seat the entire time especially nearer to the end when the stakes became extremely high. Not to mention, This film has the best montage I've ever seen in film.

I think however, that Parasite is the best film I have seen from him. Don't judge this movie on the US trailers, I felt they did a really bad job marketing the film, they made it look really pretentious. In reality, the actual movie isn't anything like that trailer. This is a dark, funny, insane, crazy, and thought provoking film. I won't get too much into the plot as I feel it's something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family, the Kims, who try and take advantage of a rich family, the Parks. Things get complicated from there. The acting in this movie is phenomenal, everyone here gives their A game. The directing by Bong Joon Ho is simply masterful. The screenplay is smart, creative, darkly funny like a Coen Bros movie (it reminded me a lot of Fargo especially), and is pure insanity at points. The film doesn't take sides on either family, they both do pretty bad things but at the same time, you surprisingly care about them, despite how flawed both of them are. The halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments I have seen all year. The movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in Korea. The cinematography is beautiful, especially those big wide shots of environments. The editing is exquisite, no scene goes on for too long, they make every second of this film matter, and I never felt bored by the film, the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me. The music is also pretty good as well. Overall, Parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year. It has great performances, amazing direction, one of the best screenplays of the year, and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Go into this movie as blind as you can, the less you know, the better."

I prefer this, I rarely watch trailers for this very reason (the modern trend of giving too much away in trailers pisses me off). The opening is delightful, a young Korean family out of work and living in poverty, but looking out for one another, keeping positive and striving to help themselves. It's touching, heartwarming and even the slight squalor is beautifully shot. Good fortune finds it's way to them as the children begin tutoring jobs for a wealthy family living in the sort of show home that an episode of Grand Designs would die for. It's not until half an hour in, that this new hope gives way a little. Just a little crack, almost undetectable. What unfolds over the next two hours though is a masterpiece in tense deceit. I'm loathed to give too many details but suffice to say, this is a beautifully dark tale that reveals itself slowly and with such grace, it's nothing short of perfect. I don't think I can recall a film with such intense levels of humour and brazen deception built on the simplest of premises, desperation to survive. The plot, cast, cinematography, every damn facet, flawless. The deft twists of the characters as to who is good and who is bad, as the tension rises to unbelievable yet plausible levels is ridiculously gripping. Even the finale which after such mastery is bound to disappoint, does anything but. I know it's only January, but this surely has to be film of the year."

Disguising itself, at first, as a comedy layered with social criticism, the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius, with moments that will literally take your breath away. Bong Joon-ho crafts a near-perfect movie, with top-notch careful directing, beautifully flawed and intense writing, heart-wrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals. But in the end, ""Parasite"", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it. 9,8 / 10"

So many undertones are explored and subtly depicted through the runtime of the movie. If foreign language films are anything like this movie, it is bound to have more nominations from across the world for the Academy's best picture award. The movie fantastically talks about social stratification and class-divide and how struggle and entitlement eats up the humanity inside.The genius screenplay and plot-line is accompanied by artistic sense of cinematography and an incredible score. The ensemble cast have shown ingenuity in playing the characters. The one question that remains even after the end of the movie is who is the ""Parasite"" or is just the concept of hope for a Utopian world and fulfillment of all desires or simply our ""real"" society. Its a must-watch! The use of architecture, design, imagery and visual composition is magnificent. The daylight shows the better, a more hopeful and upper echelon way of life whereas the dungeons like basements and semi basements show how life feels trapped, difficult and how it ""stinks"" of poverty. Bong Joon Ho has masterfully drawn parallels and intersections between the two kinds of life and the chosen way to represent them, from an architectural stand point, says volumes. The camerawork is exquisite in depicting serious situations which have greater impact on the whole story. The parts to whole and whole to parts sequencing of shots brings to each scene a sense of completeness, yet a mystery that continues onto the next."

Back in time as everyone was talking , I thought ""okay it has to be something special that's why everyone is recommending"" and on top of that the film won Best Picture in Cannes film festival , was also nominated by Oscar in couple of categories. Also won several awards in Golden Globes. And when there is so much hype about something obviously we all want to watch it immediately. But as it was not released in India , I had no options other than to wait.. Finally after huge public demand they released the film in several multiplexes. Sadly on a very low scale. After some time I watched it and My God , What an experience! I was just looking at screen with my wide eyes open throughout the runtime. I wanted to understand what Director is trying to convey through it. I had my imagination about it like ""oh it'll be some commercial sci-fi alien film or zombie action film"" , you know something like that... But HELL NO. It was nothing like that , infact not even close. With every upcoming scene my all the imagination was fading away like a weathery cloud. As if the Director made it just to prove me wrong. Jokes apart but it was really unexpected. Every scene was interesting and metaphorically shot. Visual storytelling is one of the beauties of Parasite. And of course those periodic twists. Damn. Shortly , The film was engaging and especially if you haven't watched the trailer or if you don't know anything about the plot , this film will surprise you so much more.. and I have personally experienced it. During the whole time I couldn't even imagined or guessed whats going to happen next ? So , you can watch this film. You should watch this film and try to find what it tries to speak. It started as a black comedy , then it became a family and social kind of drama , after some time it was a thriller , again after some time it was a mystery , later it was a revenge , climax was horror and ending was a tragedy! I mean what else can I say? Seriously man that Director 'Bong Joon-ho' is a South Korean diamond. After Parasite I watched some of his previous work and was mesmerized by this man's vision and brilliance of storytelling. 'Memories of Murder - 2003' , 'Okja - 2017' , 'The host - 2006' , 'Mother - 2009' are some his movies that I want everyone to watch. This are more or less equally good movies that you will not regret after watching."

I knew Parasite was going to be good, but I didn't expect it to be THAT good. Parasite starts off with a simple premise. Yet, with what Bong Joon-ho accomplishes in this film is worthy of praise and reward. Every twist and turn is unexpected and the execution of the film is perfect. No other word I can use to describe this film: perfect. Every character in this film is ones that viewers can emphasize with. The themes of class conflict (also seen in Boon-ho's Snowpiercer) prevails in this film as well. It's stunning to see these dynamics play out. In parts where you expect to know how the story will turn out, another curveball is thrown that catches the viewer off-guard. Yet nothing destroys the suspense of reality. There were moments in the film where I was biting my nails in suspense. 5/5. The timing, pacing, and execution of this film will be studied in future generations of filmmaking. This is by far one of the best films I've seen this year."

But outside of the class differences, the movie acts a good comedy as well in which you will be smiling at all the various antics of the Kim family does in order to fulfil their plan.

""Parasite"" presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet. The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue. And what if you are neither parasite nor host, would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing? It's very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film."

We are introduced to this South Korean family (the Kim family) as they are getting ready to eat. The below ground level home has few street-level windows as they look up from the table to see a drunk young man peeing on a wall near their home. We can tell the family is barely making it financially from the looks of the room, the view outside the room, and by their sparse, cryptic, and entertaining conversation. However, they seem to be engaged in their lives and hopeful because they are talking about the language of scheme making. The family consists of the father Ki-taek (played by Song Kang-ho), the mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), and the daughter Ki-woo (Park So-dam). Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk (Park Seo-joon) comes by their home, wanting to give Ki-woo a present. It is a rock sculpture that is supposed to bring economic well-being. Because Min-hyuk has to leave town for a while, he tells Ki-woo about a tutoring gig he wants him to take over while he's gone. The subject of his tutoring is a rich high school girl named Park Dye-hye (Jung Ji-so). Dye-hye's mother, Park Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong), Min-hyuk says, isn't too bright, so he should easily pass the interview. Ki-woo expresses his worries that he'll be found out and may not be good enough, but Min-hyuk assures him that even though he's only got a high school education, he'll dazzle the ditzy Mrs. Park. When asking Min-hyuk why he's giving him this offer, Min-hyuk explains that he didn't want one of his college friends doing the gig because he loves this girl, wants to date her when she's out of high school and knows that Ki-woo is a true friend and wouldn't cross him in this way. Arriving at the Park home, he's let in by the housekeeper Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Walking through the house, he's amazed at what a sizeable beautiful home it is. It's very modern and filled with all the luxuries he's never known and only dreamed about. The interview with Mrs. Park goes very well, and he's hired to tutor Dye-hye. Noticing artwork around the home, he asks about it. The mother explains that it is her wild son who shoots bows and arrows around the house. But he's also an artist and Mrs. Park thinks her son could be compared to the Andy Warhol anointed artist Jean-Michael Basquiat."

In the main role, a family of poor people who get a job in the house of the rich. At first glance, it seems that the name ""Parasites"" obviously expresses the author's opinion about the main characters. But then you realize that the main characters are shown with great love, and the author would not like to call them guilty. But the rich family is not exposed as antagonists, they are naive, kind people, as much the main characters as the poor. It is not possible to call the third family parasites. Then who are the parasites? I would say that the parasites in this film - and this is what makes movies valuable to me-are rather States, social statuses. Poverty, as well as wealth, are parasites, they set boundaries, they deform people, and people are not really to blame, people by their nature do not seek evil, they are only victims. If we talk about the plot and the overall feeling of the picture - it is dynamic and interesting, the dialogues are cute, the plot is constantly developing and growing, and resembles Kafka, in the sense of growing and growing absurdity. In General, the film is a Comedy, it is easy to watch, through the whole picture there is a light humor and irony, from this the ending becomes surreal - it is even more felt that all the characters are victims. Also in the film there is an extremely pleasant and easy symbolism. Very interesting is accompanied by the movement of the plot and characters of the symbol of water, which at one point becomes a flow, a symbol of the smell, which becomes smell, the use of characters for foreign words, the idea of ""plan"", which gradually develops one of the characters, the stone that brings wealth and relationship of the hero with him. This gives room for intellectual play and a more complete immersion in the picture and situation. It is impossible not to say that the film is damn beautiful and flawlessly shot. I would like to say something about dialogues - sometimes they are so vital and interesting that it takes your breath away. I liked the ending very much, apparently the author still comes to the sad conclusion that no matter what, poverty can not be overcome, you can not cross the boundaries that the characters are trying to break. 10 out of 10"

I hate myself for not seeing this movie sooner. Holy hell...that was just...INCREDIBLE! This is seriously the greatest film I've sat through. This was the biggest emotional rollercoaster I've ever been through. Give me any genre, this movie will cover it masterfully. This was a masterpiece. A masterpiece that greats like Martin Scorcese have yet to feat. You have no idea how hard that is for me to say because I adore Scorcese's movies. And like many, I regard him as one of the greatest filmmakers of our time next to Spielberg. Bong Joon Ho can't get more possible praise because his work, and his breathtakingly talented cast was just amazing! I think I just watched a classic. A modern classic that will be studied for all time to come. I was happy that Parasite won most of their awards at the Oscars, including establishing a landmark for the Oscars by being the first non-english film to win Best Picture. But after watching this masterpiece, If Parasite didn't win Best Picture at the Oscars this year, and it went to films like Joker, 1917 or OUATIH, it would be the worst Oscar year in history. I'm telling you, if you don't watch this, you can't consider yourself a true movie lover, because this movie has made it practically impossible for all succeeding Best Picture winners to live up to this. WATCH IT! Final Rating- 70/10"

And as you'd usually expect from a Bong film, the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name - ""Parasite"" - suggests. Though, it depends on how you take it & what you'd like to call it because ""stairway"" remains as another option as well. How? That's the beauty of this two hour long flick. Why? Let's discuss! And to begin with, there's the plot that on paper didn't particularly make a lot of sense as it's expected from a satire in general. But the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty, giving the film a base to build upon. No matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were, the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially. Supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth. Each and every actors, in their respective roles, probably have outdone themselves in that regard. On a technical note, the cinematography in particular, deserves a lot of credits. Hong Kyung-pyo managed to capture the essence of two types of Korea, something which was extremely important for the film in itself, while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable. The entire set-up of the film, that provided the innocence and realistic touch, deserves a lot of extolling. At the end, the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together. Supervised by CJ Productions (and of course, Bong) with a tight budget, it'd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed I've been by their mind-blowing piece of work. But everything aside, what packs the ultimate punch? The theme of differences of classes and how it's showcased through the ""stairways."" Call it pessimistic as you may like, or realistic for the sake of argument, the harsh reality doesn't change. That said, do you stop dreaming? No. But sometimes you get carried away in the sea of hopes, which may be ""greed"" for many. The dependency on lower classes & prison of wealth is something the film depicts so very uniquely. And the ending eventually solidified whatever, pessimistic for some and realistic for many, Bong wanted to claim; or rather ask you."

Bong Joon Ho should be considered to join those greats on the list. If I want to watch a movie with unique storytelling, powerful characters and unexpected twists, this is the director I go to. The only two memories that I have for Bong are Snowpiercer (one of the best sci-fi movies that is more than just a typical sci-fi movie) and Okja (among the best Netflix movies ever), but those are memories I cherish. Move along, you two, because Parasite not only knock those two aforementioned movies off as my best Bong movie, but it may be the best Korean movie I have ever watched. The movie about two families of vastly different wealth gaps brought insight into the faults of our society, especially how we perceive the rich and poor. The poor Kim family needed to make ends meet found an opportunity when the son got a job opportunity to work as an English tutor at the rich Park family's daughter. That became a domino effect as one by one, each Kim family member schemed to work for the Park family through ingenious ways but not all was rosy as it seems. I'll stop here as if I continue on, I will spoil the story. It has twists so shocking my jaw was on the floor multiple times without me realizing. Parasite, just like other Bong movies, crosses over different genres with relative ease. It is a black comedy, a satire and a thriller all in one. To call it a ""Family Tragicomedy"" as what the trailer suggests is a gross understatement for what it is worth. It is not a tragedy. It is not a comedy. It is not even an amazing piece of art. No, it's a revolutionary masterpiece only Bong could make. As for the other elements, the acting is sublime, the cinematography flawless and the dialogue humorous and realistic. I could not pinpoint a single flaw in the movie. In conclusion, I was not surprised at all when Parasite beat Once Upon a Time in Hollywood for the Palme d'Or because after seeing it, I had nothing but praises for the movie. Worth seeing the movie more than once if you have the time to do so. Do not miss this movie at all (and bring along a cup of dry ram-don with optional sirloin steak, if you need to). (Watched the movie at Cathay Cineleisure, 2 July 2019)"

Some of them loose their homes and sleep in public places and others find the same rain refreshing in their cars. Some of them say they are their where they should be but never see the potential those peoples have. They are sleeping hungry just because no one gives them chance. Kim family told how easily they can get what rich peoples have but they should not be there because they are weak and deserve that lower place. That girl of park family fall in love with Kim's son but just because he was sitting near her what if he was a servant she would have kicked him, as simple as that. We talk about changes but still fear what this society thinks and somewhere we know we can rise but that sound never comes out just because of this noise of them. Many morals this movie can give but for me the best part was this brain is a bridge and as soon as we increase our thinking 'A cockroach can eat the food of Those rich pets'"

Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite. Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that. The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."

Without doubt this director has a cabinet that cripples some of the historically best, but has been underestimated for over a decade. Parasite does what so many others cannot achieve. Successful genre-twisting, combing elements of classical horror, dark humour and enriching drama so successfully that you'd think it's a class of its own.

You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way.",2020-02-03,imdb,"It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime. Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. However, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place. But the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious ""haves vs."

It's class struggle, of course. But here it seems that Bong wants to put the lens over a peculiarly American idea: ""trickle down"". ""Trickle down"" - here it is, in color. Here it is: in detail. Complacency and entitlement at the top. Desperate scheming at the bottom. Just what Regressive politicians all over the world say should happen. There is even a scene with an expensive table covered with crumbs - crumbs which are then swept on the floor - crumbs from the rich man's table, which are what the Kim family is supposed to be happy with. But they're not happy, and anyone who believes ""trickle down"" is a workable system should watch this story unfold and ask themselves: Is there dignity here? Is there peace of mind? Or is this all just leading to a terrible collision? A strange choice for the fat cats of the Academy to mark as Best Picture - but a story that everyone needs to see."

I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem.

All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."

Dong-ik says of Kim, ""He never crosses the line."" Consequently, he hasn't had to fire Kim. Paradoxically, Bong's ""Parasite"" purposely 'crosses the line', often amazing us or has us thinking, WTF? That's the inspired genius of Bong and Jin Won Han's screenplay, and Bong's visionary art. There's the curious dynamic. Aside from genuinely charming Woo-sik Choi, who plays Kim's son Ki-woo (also known as Kevin), the Kim and the Park families are essentially unsympathetic. ""It's all about them"". In the bizarre star-crossed love story, Kevin is in love in with the Parks' daughter Da-hye, played by cute innocent Ji-so Jung. Bong and Jin construct their narrative: The poverty plagued Kim's insinuate into the lives of the very rich Park's. Innocuously, Ki-woo's best friend Min, played by bright charismatic Seo-joon Park, asks him to tutor Da-hye Park (Ji-so) while he's away at college. Really, Min asks Ki-woo to look after Da-hye, because Min is in love with her. Yeah, we get how that will go. Min cautions that her Mom Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong) is rather unique. Initially, Yeon-kyo occurs as the unhappy wife and substance abuser. Although, Ki-woo is not the college graduate, his adept sister Ki-jung, played by beautifully acute So-dam Park, brilliantly forges her brother college degree documentation for his job interview with Yeon-kyo. He goes by Kevin. Once acquiring Da-hye's tutor gig, Ki-woo deduces the way to get his sister Ki-jung (So-dam) as the art teacher for Park's troubled son Da-Song, played by untamed Hyun-jun Jung. Ki-jung poses as cousin Jessica. Similarly, the Kim's infiltrate as familial imposters in the Park household. Mom Chung-sook, played by sensible Hye-jin Jang, replaces legacy Housekeeper Moon-gwang, played by solid Jeong-eun Lee. Now, the poverty riddled Kim's vicariously roll in wealth and luxury. At the zenith of their dysfunctional excess, the family parties in complete inebriation in the pristine Park living room, while the Parks are on camping vacation. Naïve Ki-woo even fantasies of one day marrying Da-hye, the love of his very young life. Eventually, Director Bong's narrative spirals into the absurd macabre at warp speed. Honestly, I was the only person laughing out loud in the theater at times."

I couldn't have been more wrong, Parasite is fantastic, it nails a lot of technical aspects such as: Cinematography,editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year. These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful. It doesn't villanize any one class, both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic. The acting is also really strong I can't put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort. On the negative end however, some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film (Specifically the birthday party sequence), I just didn't agree that this would be something the character would do, I still found the actions performed to be entertaining, I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well. Overall, Parasite is a very well directed, written and acted film, which is enhanced even further by its excellent, cinematography, production design and editing. With great performances from an excellent ensemble, Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise."

Korean director Bong Joon-ho has such control over the narrative and the camera that we often feel in a Hitchcock or Tarantino movie or even Italian neorealism. And it all flows smoothly. The film begins as a custom comedy. Kim Ki-woo's family (Choi Woo-sik) lives so far below the poverty line in Korean society, that resides in a basement. They're always trying to capture wifi signals from surface neighbors, or leaving the windows open to benefit from the plagues fumigation made by the city hall on the streets. The boy's life experiences a turnaround when a friend who is taking a trip abroad indicates him as a tutor to a girl he is teaching English. The friend is in love with the girl and trusts Kim, who knows why, to keep her safe. Changing his name to Kevin, the boy begins his classes at the magnificent home of the fancy family, and, as expected, the girl Park Da-hye (Jung Ziso) soon falls in love with him. But your dream is much more ambitious: getting a job for your whole family in the house. First, he convinces the girl's mother Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong in great acting) to hire an art psychologist named Jessica, actually her sister Ki-jung (Park So-dam) for the hyperactive younger son. Using tricks, the Kim family's father and mother are soon admitted to the house. And on a Parks trip, they celebrate at their ""new"" residence. After that apparent happy ending, everything changes in the movie. Former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) returns home and brings with her a great secret hidden until then. The outbreak of this surprise causes scenes worthy of a thriller, which only ends with the unexpected return of the Parks. What follows are comical scenes and amenities, until the terrible birthday of little boy Da-son (Hyun-jun Jung). From there, chaos, destruction, and despair. And an ending. Or would it be two?"

It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again. The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust. At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor? The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level."

Parents and young adult son and daughter, accepting all available, low paying jobs, putting up with indignities, exploitation and starvation wages. Life just isn't fair. When through an unexpected gift of a mysterious rock, the family's fortune begins to change for the better, there is a brief period of joy. By a series of clever deceptions, first the son, then each of the other family members gain employment with an upper class family. Soon feelings of guilt overcome them. Is their obvious fraud hurting others? How can anyone begrudge them their sudden good fortune? Is it all part of a higher plan? This film is a delightful tour de force of not only the story and cast, but a powerful psychological journey as seen through the eyes of one young man, who is seeking meaning in his life; the opportunity to make his family proud, to accomplish great things. In the context of the story, it is a most selfless, loving heart, seeking a plan to help those less fortunate. This is a film filled with magic and warmth. There are very, very few films out there, with a message of optimism and reflection as powerful as in ""Parasite"". Having seen thousands of films in my life, this one receives a rare 10/10, and my highest recommendation. Don't let the sub-titles (or French Dub) scare you. You are definitely going to like this picture!"

Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem."

Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try."" The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes. But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder. But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time. Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded."

When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well. Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death. Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work. When I watch films like ""Parasites"" my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it."

Yes, I am being sarcastic. That's all I have left when talking about a society where the hardship of extreme poverty is often contrasted with the excesses of extreme wealth. You might argue that without such problems in our society we wouldn't have so much material to work with and create such wonderful stories as the one depicted in Parasites. Good point, but I will get back to this at the end of my review. The Kim family's struggle to survive is wonderfully illustrated with a perfect balance between funny and sad. We often feel like laughing but then, strangely enough, we also feel like we shouldn't. Something that will quickly become obvious is the connection between the members of the Kim family. They are acting as a tight unit. One might think that's normal since people usually unite against a common enemy, in this case, poverty. But it is also true that this is a family, not just a group of poor people. They care about each other. Anyway, coming back to the plot, they will interact with the rich Park family and that's all I think I should tell you. How they will do it, what will happen as a consequence is a complex plot which moves like a rise to the top of a mountain, followed by a rapid descent once we passed the peak. You will know immediately when that happens. This moment, obvious to me, was nevertheless striking and masterfully done. As my step-daughter brought to my attention, no one is the main character, all the main characters, all 10 of them, are important, and extremely well acted. Music is used parsimoniously and judiciously as a counterpoint to accelerated sequences which help keep the plot flowing smoothly, and therefore, avoids dead times. The camera work, although sometimes creative, is most often straight to the point. It shows us the situation and wastes no time on useless but beautiful imagery. In other words, every shot counts. This movie, while telling us an interesting story, is also a social statement. And, as I indicated at the beginning of this review, I see this as a great illustration of the consequences of living in a sick society. Sure, it is nothing new, but it brings to mind many questions. The most important to me: do we, as a species who is supposed to be intelligent, continue in the current direction, and continue to make interesting stories, or do we stop, clean up our act, and create only fantasy stories in worlds which are not our own?"

I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better. The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world."

You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear. Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best. As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it."

Getting all the praise in the world from audiences and critics alike, it's being called the movie of the decade. On top of this, it has won 4 Oscars including Best Picture. But I assume you already knew that, in which case I apologize for wasting your time. But if the hype and those Oscars aren't enough to convince you to watch this then maybe reading on further will. Parasite doesn't stick to a single genre but is a mix of drama, comedy, satire, mystery and suspense. All this fit into a 2 hour movie without causing a hitch in the seamless transitions between those genres. Fueled with incredible performances from each and every cast member, the movie ,despite being a thriller, involves a plot which is so believable, that it's frightening. Wildly unpredictable, the title of the movie will only make sense after the ending and till then, you'll only be left guessing. Not revealing the details, but the movie seems to be going in a certain direction at which point it takes a sharp turn into complete madness. Things pretty much escalate from there, revealing a clearer picture about the intention of the movie. The more praiseworthy thing apart from the flawless camera work and near perfect direction, is the display of the disparity between the rich and poor using symbolism and other It paints a picture about what it's like to be on both sides without the presence of any heroes or villains. I personally think that movies have become such an inherent part of our lives and their global presence has at least touched if not influenced a lot of people. And not using such a powerful, widespread medium to communicate about a social cause ( of which we have plenty) seems like a wasted opportunity. So kudos to director Bong Joon-ho for taking on this issue and yet finding a way to make it entertaining!"

While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language."

The cinematography is beautiful. The colors look mesmerizing throughout the whole runtime. They manage to make even simple dialogue scenes interesting with complex camera movements and angles. The color palette perfectly matches the moods of the scenes. The acting is mostly pretty good from all actors involved. The dialogue and characters are well-written, memorable and compelling. It's extremely well-directed. The locations feel realistic and like their a character. The suspenseful scenes are well-made and executed. They're suspenseful and you sit on the edge of your seat. The montages where multiple are happening are well-edited. You know what's going on since it's been recently established. The editing is fun and fresh. It manages to both thrilling, scary and funny without any of them ruining the others. The suspenseful parts are suspenseful, and the comedy is placed at inappropriate parts. The music choices and score match the scenes they're in perfectly and they never feel out of place. The scary parts are well-executed and photographed and they're genuinely suspenseful. It never felt forced or misplaced. There is, of course, no comedy randomly placed in the middle of a tense scene like there is in most modern-day movies. I don't think there is a single thing about this movie I dislike. It is by far my favorite movie of the year. This is a movie everyone would enjoy. I don't think there's a single person I wouldn't recommend this to."

With its superb visuals that are full of metaphorical shots and an incredibly talented cast, the film delivers a captivating commentary on the stark contrast between rich and poor - those who are destined to rule and those who are destined to serve; how being one or the other defines who you are, and the lengths that the latter is willing to go to when striving to change that. Whether you agree entirely with the iconic director's bleak outlook doesn't affect how fantastic of a viewing experience his latest work is."

However the implied message behind the movie is also matching with a complex base level story which surprises the audience with every passing moment. No I know that many people are turned off at the sight of subtitles, but I hope that if this is the only factor keeping you from watching this movie, I beg you to overlook it and enjoy this incredible cinematic experience. I think that this movie has a really unique way of showing the gaps between the social classes that exist. I find that just like Metropolis there are several consistencies between the two, but at the base of this there is one single theme; The rich despite relying on the working class often take advantage of them. Now this movie may have gone to the extreme showing how some people just can't take the oppression and they eventually crack but I think that it was important for the filmmaker to show how social conditions set up the downtrodden to fail. I absolutely loved how this movie developed and found myself watching it three times in a row ad each time I discovered a new feeling for the film. So that being said I gave this movie a 9/10 because I think that with every viewing there is more to take away from this film."

One must learn, adapt, and get their hands dirty just to maintain life's basic necessities. All the while one must cope with the knowledge that there are those that will look down on you because of circumstances that, whether deserved or undeserved, can chip away at ones spirit. All societies have their strata, and one method of survival at the bottom of the rung is to cling to those at the top. Such relationship can be mutual, but it can also be parasitic. I assume anyone reading this can guess the kind that forms the base of this movie. Director Bong Joon Ho does not need me to sing his praises, but I will say this, Memories of Murder is one of my favorite films of all time. He has created a host of other good films as well (see what I did there) and Parasite is no different. His direction is a compelling and methodical dissection of two worlds. One if for the poor where they live surrounded by concrete and wire, and below peeing drunkards. The other is a beautiful triumph of architecture surrounded by trees and sunshine, a house worthy of a success. Parasite was a roller coaster of a watch that never lingered. Keeping the viewer engaged, the movie shifts tone at various points, and the direction never misses a step. As the two worlds collide, thanks to the machinations of the downtrodden, I was kept of the edge of my seat not quite able to sense what was coming next. Accented by some fantastically comical scenes towards the beginning, the movie manages to maintain a sinister tone. Performances blend into scenes as characters playing other characters dance around and play off each other seamlessly. It feels grimy and unsettling to watch, both because of the conditions the poor are subject to, but also at the levels they will stoop to. There is something violative about watching a family's intimate space be invaded. The forecast does not look bright for any party involved. The picture painted here is detailed and rich, and full of superb performances, especially from the youngest members of the poor family. As for criticisms, I have very little. Did I love it as much as Memories of Murder? No, but that is more a result of this film, while feeling extremely relevant in this day and age, hitting on a tone that has been explored to high heaven before, the haves vs. the have not. That is not to say Parasite has nothing new to say, although that case can be made, it just lacks a certain kind of rawness."

Classism is an age-old separation that has been symbolized in literature and television for years and years. The ""good guy"" is wealthy, and the ""bad guy"" is poor, or vice versa. That isn't always how it works in real life, and Parasite strives to exemplify that. I would be gravely mistaken if I didn't mention the phenomenal acting and breathtaking cinematography that takes place in Parasite. The tension that begins to build about halfway through the movie is palatable, and will make your stomach knot. I recommend going into this movie with no spoilers and very little prior knowledge of the film, as it'll make the experience that much better. I've seen a lot of 3-7 star reviews claiming that they don't ""get the film"", and that it is over-hyped. You need to be able to look past the superficial to understand this film. Good and bad are obsolete, and classist stereotypes are shattered into pieces. Go into this film with an open mind and an agreement to think past what you see on the screen. There is a lot of symbolism and reading between the lines in this film, and to fully understand it, you'll need a good hour to think after the film. As you're laying in bed, wondering what the hell you just saw on screen, it'll all start piecing together in your brain. That's what makes a good film, and Parasite is one of the best I've seen this year."

The long, slow shot passes through the cramped living space on the ground floor, and the characters are drawn one by one. In the cluttered and narrow semi-basement, the plot of searching for network signals and pizza boxes soon leads the viewer smoothly into the narrative atmosphere of life. The combination of deliberate camera speed and quick message delivery is so precise that it has proven the power of director bong joon-ho. When stepping into the mansion that moment, ""parasites"" and the real story gradually away, but into the structure and framework of social fable. That doesn't mean the director has given up on story and suspense, though. It's certainly not the freehand brushwork of burning, which won critical acclaim last year but lost popularity, but it's similar to the metaphors and hints in snowpiercingly, and even to the themes of class and destiny. An undetected basement, like that set by many science fiction works, becomes a space device that isolates the class and tests humanity. The passage about family education can naturally get heated discussion from domestic audiences who are in the middle of anxiety. The depiction of high-asset families in the film is a kind of deliberate label misreading, which makes all members look silly and indifferent, which is obviously not true. But the director quickly deflects the viewer's confusion with exquisite technical expertise. First of all, the suspense and conflict in the script are constantly pushed forward, which makes the audience hardly pay attention to the serious injury in the life picture, which also becomes an important evidence to question its commercial genre. But I have to admit that this is the subtlety of the script, every character has realized their own appearance, deduction, transformation and account, every props given to the camera, whether stone, secret door, tea table or induction lamp, have been effectively used, become an important force to promote the story. What is exquisite is the scene itself. The three important locations of poor families, rich people's villas and underground secret rooms are all arranged in a very real and rich way. The seemingly random close-ups can accurately present the emotions of each scene and the differences between each other."

It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings. Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads. The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie."

It became the first foreign film to win best picture and for good reason. Parasite is one of the most original movies I've seen in a long time. From the jaw dropping suspense, to the social commentary, the one word I have for this movie is meticulous. The film follows the poor Kim family as they hatch a scheme to infiltrate the very wealthy Park family. The concept is simple enough, but the story both subverts and exceeds your expectations as the plot snowballs out of control. The movie is a showcase at building suspense. As the movie goes on the tension grows higher and higher until we get the payoff in the climax. The movie's script is just so great! The characters are written profoundly and every scene means something to all the characters, the themes and the story. The cinematography in this is also really great. Another thing that really stands out is the messaging and how it is conveyed. The audience is treated with the upmost respect from director Bong Joon Ho as he never is heavy handed delivering this social theme. The theme is conveyed is symbolism and metaphors and it works amazingly. I really loved Parasite and it is probably a close second for my favorite movie of the year after The Irishman. It is definitely somewhere in my top 15 favorite movies of the decade if not too 10. The movie is extremely creative, original, and meticulously created. I'm happy to say that Parasite stands amongst some of the greatest foreign films ever made. 9.5/10"

Certainly Parasite might feel uneven to some audiences because of its radical shifts in tone -- from clever comedy to violent, dark tragedy -- but it's more likely that Bong has executed everything as planned. Each insignificant detail, from the young boy Da-song's love of Native Americans to a peach allergy to the Kim family's sad little half-basement apartment, has been planted for some specific, exacting reason. Cleanly and slickly constructed, Parasite takes perverse pleasure in scamming the rich during its leisurely, funny first half, and that pleasure is contagious. When the second half comes, it's not only a narrative shock, but it also forces viewers to ask hard questions about why the first half was so enjoyable. In earlier films Bong slyly explored the impact that humans have had on our environment. In Parasite, he looks at an even bigger picture. He wonders why humans tend to look away from, or insulate themselves from, others' troubles and suffering. In this movie, reaching the high ground is certainly desirable, but those occupying the low ground aren't going anywhere."

Parasite is a great movie and one that I found myself thinking about over and over, days after I watched it in the cinema. For those that haven't seen it, it's very hard to describe what sort of movie this is. Part heist, part thriller, very 'Hitchcockian', it's incredibly tense and often very funny. It's amazing how invested you can be in a film with no clear 'good or bad guys', no one in this film is a hero. Parasite is laden with social commentary, some subtle and some not so! At times it walks the line between believable and unbelievable and will have you questioning every characters morales at one point or another. It is perfectly paced and wonderfully shot. I didn't love the very end, that's not to say I didn't get the message it was portraying, I just didn't think it was quite up to the standard of the rest of the film.

Following on with his ability to mix and match genres with an ever-present dark vein of humor seeping through his narratives veins, Ho has hit it big with the surprise 2019 hit Parasite, that now sits pretty in the IMDB Top 50 films of all-time and stands head and shoulders above other foreign films from 2019 in regards to box-office takings off a small scale budget of a couple of million dollars. Incomparable to any other film you could think of, Parasite is a very original beast, that believe it or not combines drama, comedy, thriller and even moments of horror to ensure that its many twists and turns and social commentary co-inhabit to create an entirely unpredictable experience that is best watched with as little pre-understanding as possible. Centered around the below the poverty line Kim family and their new employment in the household of the wealthy Park family, Parasite allows Ho to weave together a loaded plot-line that may seemingly be headed one way, only to surprise us all as it veers further and further away from the expected. Wonderfully played out by its core cast, with highlights from Kang-ho Song as father Ki-taek and Hye-jin Jang as mother Chung-sook, Parasite is the type of unnerving film that keeps you mentally on edge throughout as you're glued to the screen, unable to turn away from a disaster in the making that must surely be headed towards a finale as wild as we would expect from a director like Ho. As you watch the expertly directed, edited and scored film, one that has you laughing one minute and gasping for air the next, you begin to appreciate that you're watching a director operating at the top of their game, in what's still likely a career only around its halfway mark, it's exciting to think of where Ho and his inventive mind can go in the future as he continues to give us films that seem to be cut entirely from their own cloths. In an age where many films are nothing but pale imitations, remakes or sequels, its exciting to see efforts such as Parasite that give us something new, fresh and exhilarating, no doubt a reason why the word of mouth from cinema-goers helped make Parasite a world-wide smash hit and a genuine Best Picture contender at the upcoming Oscars."

Marked as the return of Snowpiercer & Okja director Bong Joon-ho in his native country, the film gained international recognition for being the first South Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at Cannes, and for being one of the highest rated films in recent years. So now that's been a year since its historical landmark, it's time to see if the movie's status is actually worthy of all the praise. The film follows the poor Kim family who start off scheming to achieve employment from the wealthy Park family and end up infiltrating their household by disguising as separate highly qualified individuals. That alone is all that can be stated about the movie without detailing too many narrative points, for as seemingly simple of a premise as this is, the whole movie goes in so many different directions. The first third establishes the state of low income poverty the Kim family is in, therefore making their desire to make money off of the upper class. From then on, the film becomes part commentary of the rich being infiltrated by the poor. As Bong Joon-ho himself stated, the film's title is derived from how the rich will end up leeching off the poor and how the poor may potentially take advantage of their positions. The Kim family themselves are so charismatic, especially the intelligent son Kim Ki-woo and the witty sardonic father Kim Ki-taek, that even if you didn't know they were a whole unit, you would buy them as their individual personas and be none the wiser at all. However, from the movie's second act onward, the plot ends up becoming a lot more complicated than your average liar revealed story. While seemingly darker and more messed up than the film's initial comedic tone, it does paint a thoroughly fascinating picture of what might happen if the ultra aristocratic landscape sucked the less fortunate in with it. Given the major theme of class warfare that is explored throughout the feature, one can imagine how passionate Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won are towards the subject matter, yet clearly not entirely one sided, as they do portray poor sides as legitimate people of different circumstances."

The duality between the protagonist family and the rich Park's is shown in such a wonderful, realistic manner. This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend - in their own original way of course. My one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts; some scenes last longer than they should. This could be a cultural difference in film-making, as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well. Still, it's not enough for me to completely give up on it. It's a proper thriller, American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade, but failed (with the exception of ""Get Out."") You laugh, you're sent to the edge of your seat, you get angry, and finally you feel sad. You know a movie is great when it's able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you've watched it. I'm glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve. I've watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers. Congratulations to everyone involved with this film, you all did an amazing job and I'm happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level. Highly recommend this film and if you're avoiding it due to subtitles or the non-sensible bad reviews, you're sorely missing out."

They don´t have a permanent job, they survive by doing temporary employment, nor can they pay for the necessary studies so that children can progress in the workplace. Thanks to a university friend, the son will be able to give private lessons to the newly adolescent of a rich family living in a large house, in which the whole family will gradually be placed. A relaxed night of fun in the absence of the owners will become, under an intense downpour and surprising discoveries, into a stressful nightmare, and from this kind social comedy a crazy thriller will be born that will mutate into black comedy. It has a very good narrative rhythm, it is a constant ascension of a ""harder still"" that surprises you at each inflection, and when it reaches its zenith you are already wondering what small mistake they will make that will cause everything to be discovered or, what new impersonation they will be imagining and thus, absolute chaos will arrive in a thrilling way that will leave you breathless. It's how to ride a roller coaster! The thing does not end here, there is a conclusion narrated in the first person by the protagonist that seems to leave everything clear, where both surprises and new dreams emerge. Bright, very bright! Everything fits perfectly, the two families seem real, and the actors do an excellent job, all of them, the comparison between the two houses is dazzling, the script is brilliant and has a good photograph director and a very good director.

But will this change the life of the poor family? DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves. Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house. Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society. From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch! The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing. So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10"

Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint. The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous.

With it's absurd language, utilizes a lot of theatrical elements. I recommend this to everyone who wants to laugh and cry at the same time. This movie will make you think about your place in society, but it will not make you sorry for occupying that place. There are a lot of movies about thic topic, but most of them take themselves too seriously, and their goal is to awake guilt in the spectator, thus the true message will be hidden under that feeling. In contrary, Parasite uses the language of humor, irony and absurdity. I think Bertolt Brecht would be proud of this masterpiece."

This is definitely one of the best movies of 2019, and it's bound to be a classic. It's directed by Bong Joon-ho, he did Snowpiercer (2013) and Okja (2017), and now he's back with Parasite and it is fantastic. From a directing standpoint, this movie is gorgeous. The cinematography is extremely well done. It's just stunning and so metaphorical. There are also sequences in this movie that will shake you and leave you on the edge of your seat. My favourite aspect is the narrative. I love the concept that Parasite is built on and what it explores throughout the movie, with the conflict and contrast between upper and lower cIasses of society. It was just beautiful to watch it play out, with its prevalence within the lives of all the characters, along with how they overcome their difficulties and how they evolve with their circumstances. The characters and performances themselves are also amazing. The entire cast is just perfect in each of their roles and I really hope they get some recognition from the Academy. I don't think many people mentioned the character arcs but I thought that was really well constructed too. The score and sound design by Jeong Jae-il was also perfect in every scenario. It brings scenes from 100 to 1000 and emphasises each tone, emotion and atmosphere. In regards to flaws, I don't think there are any major ones with Parasite. There is one decision made in the third act that I felt could've been better explored to support it. But still it didn't really bother me. Parasite is probably my favourite movie of 2019. It's funny, thrilling, emotional, satirical and hauntingly true. It's delivers everything that makes a movie perfect and shakes you to your core."

The opposite goes for the movie itself, as it humanized itself when the two most tragic characters in the movie got snapped and decided that it's enough. One of the most important movie in 2019.

Since I saw this film yesterday, I haven't been able to stop thinking about it, and it still have left a feeling in my gut and its visuals still lives in my mind. This is what movie making is all about, it's artistically beautiful, it's entertaining, it manage to capture your attention and is interesting and thought provoking. It makes you feel and think, simple put. It reminded me a little bit of Get Out, even if very different movies also. I haven't seen that many Korean movies, 5 perhaps, and some of those are some of the best movies I've seen, so perhaps should check out some more Korean movies? And Kang-ho Song has been in 3 of them I've seen, so I must believe he's a very famous actor in South Korea, but I wouldn't know. Anyway, the cast of this movie is fantastic, a bunch of very likeable actors, that portrays the absurdity, darkness, drama and comedy of these characters and situations, in an excellent way. This movie is entertaining because of the absurdity of the situations, that these people come to be within, but also still so impactful, beacuse it at the same time it all feels so realistic in a crazy way. The film, with all it different events and character projection, flows perfectly and also with beautiful, just delicious cinematography and set design. Some visuals of this picture will be in my mind for a long time. And, off course, the underlying meaning of the the film, as I think everybody knows by now, even those that haven't seen it yet, it's about class, poverty VS wealth. Something that has been going on in this world for thousands of years. As present today as it ever been, I suppose. The gap between rich and poor, it is very much a gap, that alienate the classes from each other. And what this film so intelligently does, is that it isn't hitting you over the nose with this message, it's just there, embedded in the story in an obvious but at the same time sublimely way. I think that's masterfully done by the director, beacuse I think that's a hard thing to acchive. To make such a strong comment on society and the human condition, without being obvious or preachy. Just beautiful actually. There is sympathy and distaste to be found against the personalities in both familys, with distaste perhaps being a bit of a strong of a word, their human, their very very human, and you can understand both sides. Humans are selfish by nature and both sides just does what's in their best interest."

Seemingly innocuous, ""Parasite"" captures the lively trials of the Kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment, starting an invasion of sorts. The web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible Park family opens a series of mouth watering doors, but alas, there's always some that should remain shut. Whether it's borders, classes, or smells, everyone has a line, that once crossed, destroys most semblance of rationale. ""Parasite"" brilliantly dissects how these boundaries (however personal and subjective) are developed within our very complicated and unique species. Filmed almost exclusively within the two families' domiciles, one a filthy, cramped basement apartment, the other a glorious, spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill, ""Parasite"" offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling. Delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies, hammer throw expertise, American Indian infatuations, and wifi signal hunting, are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction. Spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act. Sides are drawn early on, making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare, but not everything on screen is black and white. The consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film. What is good? What is evil? How is that line drawn? Sneaky, powerful, perfectly paced, funny, shocking, and quite wonderful. Can a film be both dark and bright? Yes, yes it can."

The movie is sure to give to chills in the spine by the end, as all the super richie-rich, goody-goody, cute-cute, sophisticated scenes suddenly goes down the drain (literally, with the floods). Loopholes: The movie would had been even more realistic if - they had shown how a person feels the pinch of sunlight when they come out of the basement and sees the sun after a long time. Rubbing through eyes and showing the transition while entering the kitchen would have made the scene look more real. Living in the basement would make the skin dull and pale. But the characters looked as healthy as ever, even after staying there for over 4 years. Instead of all clean shaven and hair styled up, showing haphazard hair growth and beards would have made the characters look more genuine. The scenes never showed any traces of blood footprints after all the murdering, especially, when Kang-ho song escapes. Plus points: Overall, it was definitely worth a watch as it showcases the socioeconomic gap and difference. As I firmly believe that there are only two religions - the rich and the poor. The movie proved that a rich person's life goes on while the poor keeps struggling for the rest of their life."

I like the every single little details described such as the master annoyed by the smell of driver. It's so vivid. The story end well without too much fuzzy parts. The director nail it by showing a serious theme but in an very entertaining way. Awesome movie!"

Parasite is a film that you should know as little as possible about before watching as it weaves such an interesting and compelling narrative that will have you hooked in minutes. It is occasionally funny, often tense, sometimes shocking and always interesting. Within ten minutes of watching the film I figured out that this would be a slow burning film where the tension rises until everything comes to ahead and it did not disappoint. The film isn't shot in a flashy stylish way but it is still beautiful to look at and is shot superbly and subtly. The acting is good across the board with all the main cast getting moments to shine. The characters are all well thought out and three dimensional all having their own desires and motives. Parasite also has a strong social commentary to make (that I wont discuss for spoilers sake) but is not heavy handed and is slightly present at the beginning before it hits you hard towards the end. This film is so close to perfect but is let down by its ending. If the film had left the ending more ambiguous and finished 5-10 minutes earlier I would have given Parasite a ten. After seeing the film there is no question on why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and is one of the best films of 2019 by far."

The themes are common enough, but told in such a way, and with such a unique story, to be legitimately fresh.

It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense. The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously. What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently. While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot."

Normally thought it would have been a comedy entertainer like those classic Korean movies.

The actors did a tremendous job playing each role and their relationships with each other.

No resentments. No creases on them."". ""It all gets ironed out. Money is an iron. Those creases all get smoothed out by money."". The Kim family, residing in the secluded darkness of a semi-underground basement apartment, acquire limited income. Jaggedly folding pizza boxes for an independent takeaway chain, with the already low-paying income reduced as a consequence of poor workmanship. They, much like the bottom-feeders of South Korea's working class division, struggle to survive. Consuming rotting food. Hijacking neighbouring paid Wi-Fi services. Residing in potentially diseased sub-urban streets. Ultimately aspiring to achieve the lofty heights of upper-class formalities. Conceptualising the popularised term ""Hell Joseon"", a critique on the current socioeconomic declining trajectory of South Korea. As the Kims tucked into their minimised dinner, son Ki-woo's university friend gifts the family a scholar's rock. Traditionally granting the bearer a promise of wealth. Swiftly after, he offers a proposition to Ki-woo. To continue his vocation as an English tutor for the elegant daughter of a wealthy family, the Parks. Ki-woo ponders, fabricating a plan that would seize this opportunity for beneficial gain. A chance to relish in the opposing scale of unequalised capitalism. After a successful lesson, Ki-woo insists his awareness for an art therapy teacher at the behest of the gullible Choi Yeon-gyo for her son. Ki-woo, unbeknown to the Parks, invites his sister Ki-jung to provide these lessons. Gradually, the Kim family, one-by-one, assimilate themselves into the lives of the Park family, pretending to be unrelated. The poor draining the wealth and opportunism from the rich. Before tackling this critically lauded feature, which has now grown to be one of the highest-rated productions of all-time in such an inconsequential amount of time, the black humour of director Joon-ho's filmography acted as preparation for what was to be expected. Providing critiques on sociopolitical endeavours that overburden an OECD nation. Predictably, yet efficiently, Joon-ho's darkly comedic satire on class conflict manages to succinctly tackle the enragement of allocated resources that supplies social inequality and wealth disparity through the microcosmic insight of two opposing families. Not just in prosperity or affluence, but in temperament. A reflection of late-stage capitalism where the enticingly inviting wealthy superfluously ignore the difficulties of life for the remaining population."

It's very well directed with a engaging background score, captivating screenplay and stunning cinematography. The film flows through multiple genres from comedy and drama in first half to horror and thriller in second. Story revolves around a impoverished household trying to procure jobs in a wealthy family using unscrupulous methods. Bong-joon-ho deals with more than one philosophical arguments throughout the movie but never loses his focus of the central plot. With masterful direction of Bong-joon-ho, film was able to smoothly transition from a tone of comedy to tragedy effortlessly. Parasite might be his best work to date."

It is just every cool, fun and clever movie shrinked into 2 hours and 15 minutes of pure and unstoppable laughter, some masive and engaging thrills and a story about the distinctio of classes and th edynamic of a family trying to make ends meet. The cinematography is really distinct andI like that Asian films have a reather common but unqiue look and tone and creates a magical atmosphere and tone. The way the camera moves is so sweet and subtle, the framing, the long shots, it is just so fun to watch. The lighting is beautiful, the way certain rooms are lit give a darker or lighter tone. It never tries to show off and everytihng feels so organic that at one point you forget you are watching fictional characters and a made-up story. The soundtrack is another thing to praise of. Most of the tracks are classic music and although it often feels so contradictory to the film, the result is so great and so much personality was added to the movie. The great thing is that despite that the characters have not such a deep arc or are given any major traits, I was able to connect with them in the end and the whole film feels like a big family struggle. You grow with them and graually start to care, in site of their anethical and cheaty choices and actions. Evey actor gives such an appealing perormance and some of their reactinons are really on spot. The humour is there mostly during the first hour. It is seet and it feels genuine, it what family members would talk and joke about. It creates an intimacy and a fun time. Then we get a lot of shifts in the tone and the twists come and go and the great thing is that the film is constalnty on the go, it is always moving forward and does not waste any moment...and in the end the Parasite is a great story toold in the best way possible. The political comentary is perfect. There is actually a film that was released last and I vastly enjoyed... ""Burning"". Biurning was about a trouble guy feeling mad that his friend is dating a ritch successful man and he has nobody and actually talks about class discretions in a fascinting way. Parasite does the sam thing but in a different way. In the movie, we see a poor family trying to work together to scam some narrow-minded ritch family that live in a huge house with their luxuries and all. It is what ""Us"" went for but done in a more clear nd subtle way."

SEE THIS IN THEATER",2019-10-29,imdb,"I had high expectations for this movie, considering it won best picture at Cannes this past year, and it exceeded them. It's a film with thoughtful socioeconomic commentary, as well as an examination of nihilism through the lens of a struggling family. Drawing on the stark lifestyle differences of an upper class Korean family, and another family that is barely making ends meet folding pizza boxes, the audience is able to visualize what a family will do to improve their current financial situation. Without giving away any spoilers, the movie is packed with hilariously sharp moments, and as an American seeing this movie reading the subtitles may have helped those moments shine even brighter. The intertwining of suspense, humor, and social commentary makes it hard not to be reminded of Jordan Peele's ""Get Out,"" so it's a blast to see it in theaters. At a time when originality is lacking at every corner, ""Parasite"" comes through in nearly every way and should be a lock for best foreign film of the year. I wouldn't be surprised if it generated some best picture buzz as well. Great movie!"

At first, it feels like a dark comedy about a poor family scheming their way into a rich household, but then it shifts into something much deeper and darker. Bong Joon-ho does an incredible job of blending genres-you'll be laughing one minute and then sitting on the edge of your seat the next. The whole cast is flawless, but Song Kang-ho really stands out as the father who's caught between two worlds. What's amazing is how Parasite tackles huge themes like class, privilege, and inequality without ever feeling preachy. Every scene is layered with meaning, and there's this constant tension building throughout. The way it all comes together in the end is just... wow. It's the kind of movie that stays with you, making you think about the society we live in and the invisible barriers that divide us.

It takes a lot for me to invest into a foreign film where I have to watch it with subtitles, and I will usually pass unless it is an exceptional film. The last such film I can remember watching was the 2007 Spanish supernatural film, ""The Orphanage"", which I did feel was exceptionally good. So, when I read the reviews on ""Parasite"" and seeing that it had won Best Picture, I decided to go ahead and take the plunge ... and I'm so glad I did. Our story starts with the Kim family, struggling financially and trying to make ends meet when the son, Ki-woo, is given the opportunity to tutor a rich family's teenage daughter. Taking the job, Ki-woo begins to manufacture reasons to trick the privileged family into hiring his father, mother and sister in various capacities, while they pretend to be complete strangers to each other. The scheme is going well, until one of the former house employees returns to the home requesting to be let in because, in her haste to leave, she had left something important behind. When they allow her inside, that is when it all begins to unravel with very unexpected results. I absolutely loved this twisted film! Despite the subtitles, I was completely sucked in, and found myself grinning with guilty pleasure at the predicaments that this opportunist family was placed into in their efforts to keep their devious plan from being discovered. The outcome was not what I expected, but completely satisfying. The pacing was excellent, the acting above average, and the cinematography solid. The film featured a strong use of lighting and colors that adds to the feel and atmosphere effectively. This is one of the few foreign films (well, foreign to me, that is) that I would highly recommend, without hesitation. It is well deserving of its praises, and well worth the time invested into it. I have added it to my own collection and am looking forward to watching it again down the road. A high 9 stars out of 10."

The rich guy who seems nice enough, but just the mere smell of the poor, or them not staying in their place and crossing the line he has in his mind which makes him quickly remind them of their relative positions ... it's a fantastic characterization, and I loved how it all built up into a crescendo with the opulence of that kid's birthday party.

Having access to someone else's free wlan is one of the main concerns of its residents for not being cut off from the world of WhatsApp. Seoul, a private fallout shelter in a modern luxurious villa. The only way left to communicate with the outside world is the light of a bulb by using morse code. In between these 2 scenes we get to see 120 min of a freaky class conflict, in which a family of unemployed sneaks access to a mansion of the riches. They get the first foot in by chance but from that point on, they show great manipulative and deceitful talent to get all feet in. Everything seems to work out fine until the former housekeeper returns in a rainy night. From that point on the story is turned completely upside down and becomes an entirely unpredictable hullabaloo. I liked the fact that the movie does not side with either of the parties. Neither poor nor rich are presented in a very favorable way. Especially the patronizing behavior of Mr. Top Manager towards his new chauffeur is quite striking and doomed to create a backlash ... Not all parts of the story are fully convincing. In my eyes, it is quite unlikely that a family of low social class has the ability to show such good manners and education as presented in the movie. Oh well, it is still a clear recommendation. You shall be surprised more than once."

These families couldn't be more dissimilar; one makes money from folding pizza boxes & steals the wifi of nearby cafes while the other lives like royalty, served by maids and taken around by drivers. The income disparity is quickly made apparent to us and in a string of events I don't want to spoil here, the poorer family finds themselves usurping one role at a time of the richer family until they all find themselves employed by the rich. And yet they have to act like total strangers with one another. How this is all written, directed and acted plays off incredibly well. ""Parasite"" really surprised me in that it takes you on a whirlwind of emotions. It's storytelling is ambitious and takes chances in veering off-tone and off-the-book, so to speak. I found myself dying of laughter at some parts, tense or sad at others and purely enchanted throughout. All of this while showcasing some of the most unique storytelling I've ever witnessed. Certain to nab a Best Foreign Film nomination at the Academy Awards and perhaps even a Best Director & Best Picture nod, ""Parasite"" is certainly one of the year's best. Arguably even one the decade's best. It's all in the little details whether it's using a keen sense of lighting, composition or blocking to reveal something. Give this one a watch and you'll see what I mean. Masterpiece!"

Especially to see how the main characters, would get through their difficulties by facing them, in the line between poverty and wealth. These stories often explore the theme about hope, to see how the main characters, who have so much will in their souls, would try in all the way to help their family. Some of these stories would end, with the main characters who become wealthy, to help their family with satisfaction. Other stories would end with the main characters, who are still struggling with what they are facing to, without losing any hope even it would take a long time to accomplish something important. The auteur filmmaker Bong Joon Ho have been interested, in making a story which explores this theme. As the audience have been really curious, what the new movie of the filmmaker would be about, once it has been announced. After a long time of work, in 2019 came out Parasite by Bong Joon Ho with Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik and Park So Dam. The movie's plot: The unemployed Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) takes the opportunity, to work as an English tutor for the daughter of the wealthy Park Family. Then Kim Ki-woo would slowly bring his whole family, his father Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang Ho), his mother Kim Chung-sook (Chang Hyae Jin) and his sister Kim Ki-jung (Park So Dam), to get each of them a job in the Park Family. Until something unexpected is going to happen, to get a dramatic consequence. From the beginning to the end, the movie would surprise the audience, through the most unexpected twists, especially if something wrong is going to happen, then the Kim Family must find new solutions to not get in trouble. In the same way, the movie gets emotional to see how the Kim family, is so united to never let anything to divide them. The monologues and dialogues were elaborated, to see how the main characters would find new plans, for what they are looking for. Also to let the audience feel the deep meaning of the dialogues and the monologues, especially between the Kim family when they talk about important topics. The camera and the lightings work to be compatible, in ever single camera movements as well as in every single angle shots, to make the sequences look like paintings needed for the Mise en scènes. The editing was specifically elaborated for the narration's rhythm, without ruining it, as well as to build tension in the most unexpected moments."

The main complaint - I was not ""blown away"" by any element of the movie. I know that's a high standard but with a score of 95 it should do exceptionally in some aspects. Instead, this movie did just ""pretty good"" in all of them. Movie about class struggles might be new and exciting to US viewers but is - I don't want to say cliched - a pretty common theme in East Asia. Juxtaposing two closely-related group of characters with some uncrossable divides that ultimately result in conflict that reflects on the society itself is also a tried and true storytelling device. Execution of the movie is professional and top-notch. Almost all actions by the characters have meticulous setups (some of them a bit in the face), which, on the bright side, shows the movie was extremely well-thought out and executed. Yet it simultaneously takes away any true element of surprise - a bit over-crafted, I'd say, which is a bit ironic in a highly choreographed dark humor genre movie but bear with me. Character arcs are well-justified but predictable; was most impressed by the detailed and vivid portrayal of classism through a non-visual medium - smell. The juxtapositions of the underground v. above ground, the pre- and post- discovered housekeeper, and the weather changes vs the mood of the characters was effective but a bit on the nose. Last, the cinematography was beautiful, the tone was unique and well-balanced, and the performance was amazing. Overall, a highly polished and accomplished movie. Yet I failed to see much ingenuity. It felt like the director hides behind his craftsmanship to avoid showing the audience his true self."

While this would be seen as a thriller by many, it's also a dark comedy. This can often a very difficult thing to pull of, as too many tones can often leave an audience confused and disengaged. It also plays to audience's expectations only to then completely subvert them when you think you know whats going to happen. Parasite executes this all of these elements amazingly through Bong Joon-Ho's incredible direction and writing. Dialogue has depth and sounds organic. The themes that Parasite explores really hit home by the end of the movie and takes us to some unexpectedly emotional resolutions of character arcs. The cast which consists of Woo-sik Choi, Hye-jin Jang, So-dam Park and long term collaborator Kang-ho Sang, are all at the top of their game here, with an especially phenomenal performance by Kang-ho Sang. Cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hung returns with might be his best work yet. The sound design is great and the score fits perfectly and helps add to the tension of the movie. All of these elements combine to make an incredibly satisfying movie, while also being highly re-watchable. When introducing someone to foreign language movie, this would be one the first i'd recommend."

The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible. Both the cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon-ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts. These three aspects together result in one of the most eye-grabbing movies of the decade. Every shot is, at the same time, beautiful and meaningful, to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues. The screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny, interesting, sarcastic, sad and verisimilar. The movie shows the difference between classes like ""Roma"" (2018), but has the rhythm and its core similar to ""Get Out!"" (2017). Every character is important and has its moment of protagonism. Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay, none of the characters is a villain or a hero. The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones. The acting by all the main cast is sublime, but the highlights are Kang-ho Song and Yeo-jeong Jo. Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, father of the Kim family. He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie, making his character's arc of development the most interesting of the film. Yeo-jeong plays Yeon-gyo, mother of the Park family. She is the complete opposite of Ki-taek; she's naive and has, and seemingly has always had, an easy life. She's clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble, and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family. Last, but definitely not least, the music. It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen. It has hints of suspense, comedy and even horror. Parasite (2019) is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and, most certainly, deserves a watch. It's eye-grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch, but is also very dense and insightful, providing a vision of how things work that's not usually shown in the mainstream content."

Of course, that is subject to change, but I can't see this being beat any time soon. Parasite is a film about which I think I should say as little as possible. Knowing nothing about the plot going in was a great benefit. The film has so much to say about class, about wealth, about family, about society. It is all so focused and direct. The movie never meanders or wanders off to other topics. It is excellently paced and has fantastic editing. The script is so well-written, both in terms of dialogue, progression of the plot, set-up and payoff, reincorporation, and commentary. The film looks fantastic, as most of this director's other pictures do. The music is pretty great, very well timed and sometimes used for comedic effect. The acting is great, too. Song Kang-Ho is great as usual, but the younger actors and the women do great as well. I especially loved Jo Yeo-Jeong's performance. I think watching this in theaters is definitely worth it if you can manage. I loved this movie. I think it is a pretty accessible foreign film. My showing was pretty full, and the next two showings were sold out entirely. I'm really happy that people are watching this, and I hope to God that the movie gets the Academy recognition it deserves. 9.5/10, could be a 10 on the second watch."

I've seen plenty of good movies from South Korea but Parasite must be the best one thus far. I was surprised (and not) it won all those Oscars but to be honest Bong Joon Ho deserves those awards. He made quality movies before, like Snowpiercer for instance, so it was only a matter of time before he got recognition. In Gisaengchung (Parasite) the acting is very good, not the typical loudspeaking Korean where it looks like they're always mad at something, so for that alone it's worth watching. The story is catching, well written, and keeps you at the edge of your seat for the entire movie. The difference between the poor and the rich, the envy, the jealousy, the scamming, it's all very entertaining. It never felt like a long movie because it's just well made and it's a refreshing story, not one of those stories that has been done over and over again.

Perhaps if Paul Verhoeven was still allowed to make slick satirical blockbusters like he used to, they'd have a shot at matching the Best Picture winner PARASITE.

But they are close knit and love each other dearly. Their latest scheme is their most ambitious and riskiest one yet: each Kim family member will get hired by the wealthy Park family for a different occupation and pretend not to be related to one another. The acting is excellent across the board. The first half is very enjoyable to watch how crafty the Kims are at tricking the affluent if foolish Parks. But then the second half takes a few shocking twists that threaten to upend the Kims' new social standing. I strongly recommend this movie, it's definitely worth the hype."

It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film."

Hustling poor Korean family demonstrating that the class divide can never be surmounted.

Bong Joon-ho's Parasite might leave you asking who are the real bottom feeders in the black comedy about social structures. There's plenty of food for thought as this picture is deeper than than what it may seem like on the surface. Mitchell Bulfin"

A couple of my friends had seen it and knowing they know what i like, urged me not to wait until Feb for its UK Release, but to try and see a preview. Luckily enough, there was a preview at Curzon Mayfair in London this week with director and lead actor introducing it and i managed get a ticket. I can safely say its the best money i have ever invested in watching a film. The best way to see this is not to know anything about it and try to avoid the spoilers which i managed to do. The Tag line on the poster ""act like you own the place"" had me intrigued, but having seen the film, it makes perfect sense. Its basically a home invasion movie that has a lot of laughs at the start but then turns very dark. The story is very cleverly told and all the cast act their socks off. There are some real surprises/shocks along the way, but all make the film more entertaining. Can clearly see why it won the Palme D'or at Cannes, ive seen nothing like it, its in my top 3 of the year and i cannot wait to see it again. Have to say its best to see with a big crowd, as the laughs and gasps that come along the way make it even more enjoyable."

The film tells the story of a poor family living in a basement without access to basic utilities. The head of the family is Mr Kim. He wants the best for the family. But he cant afford the cost of university education for his intelligent son, Kevin and brilliant daughter, Jessica. Min is a friend of Kevin. He also wants the best for his friend. He recommended Kevin to take his place as a tutor. Kevin became the personal tutor of Da-hye, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. Kevin was able to grab this life changing opportunity. First he brought in Jessica as an art teacher. The two worked intelligently and perfectly by bringing in their dad and mum as driver and househelp respectively. But nothing is so perfect in this world. What would happen it comes to knowledge that they are related as family? The film is set in suburbs and high class residential area in a typical Korean city. This gives it the affluence versus poverty touch that underlines the theme of the film. The script was suspenseful and full of excitement. The performance of Song Kang-Ho was spectucular. He blended emotions with intelligence. Directing wise, individual performances raised the bar.Everyone knew what they were doing and delivered with aplomb. The quality of the film's video editing gave it a polishing and glossing visual impressions. However, I was not impressed with the films dialogue. It did less than enough to convey the theme of the film to its audience. Paraite is going to be a film you would not quit watching. It is emotional and funny. No matter how hard life maybe there will always be a time to laugh. And if you want to laugh very well, then I recommend this film for you."

Song Kang-ho would be my personal standout, I enjoyed watching him throughout. Choi Woo-shik is very good too, as are Park So-dam and Jang Hye-jin. All of the onscreen talent do terrific though, from Cho Yeo-jeong to Lee Jung-eun. I don't have any negatives for this, it's a brilliant film.

A truly exceptional film that somehow lives up to the immense praise. It manages to be so many things at once: an operatic satire, a classist takedown, a cheeky comedy, a twisty thriller, a chilling horror, a somber rumination.

Every setup is paid off, every tonal shift deftly balanced, every progression carefully timed. The movie feels like a well-oiled machine firing on all cylinders, thrusting you through the densely layered narrative without so much as a hiccup.

Many Americans don't understand the class system of other countries, and getting to see another countries class system being represented on screen gives the film a very different type of feel. In Korea there are a lot of stricter gun laws that stop people from getting to them so in order to make a kill you would have to use other methods, and that does play a role within the context of this film and adds to the complete and utter fear that can come from it. There are also a issue for more flooding for the poor in Korea in which this film also addresses in a lot of big and massive ways throughout the film as it becomes the catalyst for why the family makes many of the choices that they choose to make within it. Parasite really does manage to capture the essence of what truly matters in our society for the poor and the rich and their differences"

The running time of the movie is of two hours but you'll feel that this is the shortest two hours you've ever spent on any movie. The director has chosen the characters very carefully and each of the characters were just artistically brilliant in the portray of their assigned character. The acting will leave you spell-bounded and the realism in the acting will leave you awestruck. The screenplay of the movie is brilliant and there are regular shocks and turns with mind boggling twists which will keep increasing the interest in the movie.

I was excited to see it as it won Best Picture at the Oscars two years ago, but I was also a little hesitant because I am not the biggest fan of subtitled films and sometimes Oscars simply reward the wrong movies big gold. Well they got it right this time. In fact the movie is so good that the subtitles certainly didnt bother me and added to my enjoyment of it. Lots of people I am sure will dismiss this film as a boring flick that the Oscars went nuts over but I say please trust the Academy on this one. This film is not slow by any means it remains entertaining throughout with very witty dialogue and situations and fine acting. If you are not a fan of dark humor you may want to skip this one as there is a lot of it but if you are it doesnt get much better than this. Highly recommended. It doesnt disappoint."

But vulnerability is inevitable and everybody is dispensable. ""Parasite"" is an allegorical masterpiece and is certainly worth all the hype it has generated over the last few months. I'd highly recommend everyone to see this film and if possible, even sample the Black & White cut of the film. I haven't seen the B&W cut myself but the director says the societal fractures that are depicted in the film are even more evident in the B&W cut. Kudos to Bong-Joon Ho and his team for conjuring up this splendidly bitter tonic. If you have seen and loved ""Parasite"", watch Jordan Peele's ""Us""."

There are some light and humorous scenes. There are also a few 'oh come on' risks akin to a sitcom, but that's how we get from there to 'holy crap what is happening here' so must take that leap with the director. The cinematography is beautiful, the pace is good but you need to pay attention. the dialogue is all valuable- When we get to the last third, it all comes together quickly. Enjoy the ride.

Some slaves had the luck to experience better living conditions than others, but none of them was ever allowed to forget that they were property. If they had a ""nice"" master, they might smile and exchange pleasantries, but the seething resentment of having a master in the first place never went away. A variation on the ""happy slave"" concept still exists in the world of today, I think, but it's been transferred to the serving class. There's this pervasive notion that those who struggle economically are happy just to be employed by those who have more. Maids, nannies, chauffeurs, doormen -- what do they exist for but to make life more convenient for the wealthy, and as long as they're well treated and paid for their efforts, what do they have to complain about? This dynamic is explored explosively in ""Parasite."" It's almost impossible to talk about the film without revealing its secrets, and this is one film that works best the less you know about it. It's funny, scary, suspenseful, sad, sometimes all at the same time. It's playful, yet serious. Director Bong Joon Ho clearly has a ball playing with genres and constantly upending our expectations. The fun of this movie is never knowing where it's going to go next. It creates a metaphor for the increasing divide between the haves and have nots in Korea specifically but the world in general by presenting us with a filthy rich family that remains blithely unaware of those who, in their eyes, exist to do things for them, even when those people are (literally) right under their feet. There aren't good guys or bad guys, heroes or villains. At times you despise everyone in the movie, at other times you feel compassion for almost all of them. It's a movie that is many things at once and refuses to be categorized, and as a result it looks much like our modern world. Grade: A"

It follows the intersection between a poor but conniving family and a wealthy, aloof family. Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) is a poor entrepreneurial type with many failed plans. He lives in a disheveled basement apartment with his wife, Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin), son, Ki-woo/Kevin (Choi Woo-shik), and daughter, Ki-jung/Jessica (Park So-dam). Ki-woo's university friend prompts him to take over the English tutoring of the high school daughter of a wealthy tech entrepreneur. Park Dong-ik (Lee Sun-kyun) is an entrepreneur who lives in a lavish architect-designed house with his flighty wife, Choi Yeon-gyo (Cho Yeo-jeong). She is a hypochondriac and unable to control their young son, Da-Song (Jung Hyeon-jun). Da-Song is the only character who sees through all the chaos. The Park daughter, Da-hye (Jung Ji-so), flirts extravagantly with Kevin. We also meet Park's housekeeper, Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), chauffeur, and a later character that plays an important role. The film follows the Kim family's successful attempt to ingratiate itself as various staff members for the Park family, the impact of this success on the Kim family's self-perception, and the great drama that unfolds when the original housekeeper returns to take care of some ""unfinished business."" The first 3/4 of ""Parasite"" is a comedic commentary about social class; the last 1/4 takes a 180-degree violent turn in its continuing class analysis. ""Parasite"" is a brilliantly-executed film. All the characters are excellent, though the Kim son and daughter lose a bit of their mojo after they successfully the Park world.

That's the bare bones of this film but it is a multi-layered black comedy thriller which heaps the satire on with a trowel but never falters as the brilliant script and direction by Bong Joon-ho keeps things going at a brisk canter. A tale of class war as the condescension shown to the servants is all too obvious, there is a line which must never be crossed by the hired help. The way the Kim family inveigle their way into the wealthy Park's home is a joy to observe. First the son as an English tutor then the daughter as an art therapist followed by the father and mother as chauffeur and housekeeper, the existing servants just cast aside. Something odd then happens which would be a spoiler if revealed but it alters the tone of the film. Things proceed towards a dark climax which ventures into the area of quotidian horror. Another masterpiece by Bong Joon-ho which he (partially) based on his own experiences as a maths tutor to the son of a well off family. 9/10."

This movie explores class disparity and criticizes late capitalism. Bong is known for his unique style and has directed acclaimed films such as Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer. Parasite continues this trend by presenting a narrative that is full of unexpected twists. The story revolves around the Kim family, who are struggling to make ends meet while living in a dim basement and dealing with unemployment. They survive by leeching off neighboring coffee shops' Wi-Fi and folding pizza boxes for money. When a local fumigator visits to spray the streets, the Kims exploit the opportunity, deliberately leaving their windows open in hopes of eliminating pests in their midst. The eldest son, Ki-woo, starts tutoring the wealthy Da-hye under the guise of ""Kevin,"" which leads to a series of deceptions. Through Ki-woo's cunning, each family member secures employment with the affluent Parks, assuming distinct roles: the sister as an art teacher, the father as the chauffeur, and the mother as the housekeeper. Gradually, the Kims infiltrate the Parks' household. At first, the film is like a comedy of manners, with the audience cheering for the Kims as they outwit the Parks. However, the Parks are not your typical wealthy family; they live in opulence, wear lavish attire, and complain about trivial matters. Beneath this facade, the film reveals their astonishing naivety and blissful ignorance of their reliance on the invisible working class. This obliviousness magnifies their despicability, challenging conventional perceptions of privilege. While the film does not absolve the Kims of their conniving actions, it raises poignant questions about their ability to truly assimilate into the upper class. Ki-woo's question to Da-hye - ""In this setting, do I fit in?"" - prompts contemplation on the feasibility of social mobility when the impoverished are forced to compete among themselves for survival, while the wealthy remain oblivious to societal issues. Despite its rich social commentary, Parasite remains thoroughly engaging and avoids the pitfalls of didacticism. The film shifts seamlessly between family drama, comedic satire, and suburban horror, skillfully dissecting the exploitative relationship between social classes."

Mr Kim and his resourceful and conniving family are working on it, but its engrained right in there. They come up with a plan to infiltrate a wealthy household and live vicariously through them. First, his son, then his daughter, then his wife and, finally, him end up working for the upper-class Park family. Their plan is simple: recommend each other to the nervous mistress of the household, while spreading mistrust about the existing staff. It's a plan which works perfectly. Bong Joon Jo's narrative, humour, incredibly beautiful and thoughtful direction is deserving of every plaudit it's received. The film just oozes intelligence, conscience and is masterclass in filmmaking. But equally as important is the casting-there isn't a passenger in this film. So-dam Park as Ki Jung, the daughter, Woo-ski Choi as Ki Woo, the son, and Lee Jeong-eun, the mother, are stand out, for me. The social commentary about class in this film is worth taking the time to watch it, even if it wasn't so thoughtfully entertaining. If this is the quality of Korean cinema, then keep them coming."

(The Lighthouse, High Life, and The Beach Bum came close but this took the cake). It was kind of like a mushroom trip, mentally, in the sense that it manages to make you feel a little bit of every single type of emotion without diving fully into any of them. It manages to weave in and out and being humorous, intriguing, and disturbing consistently, and somehow seamlessly, all while somehow feeling very simple and extremely complex at the same time. It's a film that is fully progressive in a structural sense. And it leaves you with the right amount of minor questions and wonders. Quite a fascinating and accomplished movie - worthy of the hype for sure. This BONG JOON HO is truly a crafty movie-smith. His THE HOST was my favorite film of 2006 upon seeing it, OKJA was a lot of fun a couple of years back, and this easily lives up to those two, if not surpasses them. This is not a movie I could watch over and over again because it is very much a producer of slow-burning anxiety, yet it is a near-masterpiece, if not a thorough one. Recommended."

I'll be honest I was avoiding this as I kinda knew going in it was probably going to be depressing and horrifying. There's a running theme in the cinephile community that Korea has it's genre of film, unique unto itself. In Hollywood, films often go through 5 or more drafts that start with big amorphic ideas and edge closer toward crowd pleasing sometimes until they're just 90 minute commercials for the lead actors career. Korean film seems to lack that filter of cost X audience X test screening -+ = blah blah blah. They take big ridiculous ideas and drive them towards the powerful nebulous first draft finish line no matter how emotional draining or traumatic. In a word, Korean cinema can be very ""dark"". Bong Joon-ho has a special talent for creating 4 dimensional characters, larger than the circumstances in the film and when the payoff comes for them it's likely to cause heart palpitations. Parasite is a film about grifters who invade a rich family's home, but this is no simple film about ""Oh no when will the family figure them out!?"". This is far bigger and far more shocking. Obviously it's an amazing movie. This little blurb is more here to be a warning. Gird your heart strings when heading into this."

Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here. They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class. You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too! There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless? Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!"

I eventually realized I was watching a subversive horror flick set in a beautiful house with secrets between the walls and what desperation can achieve when unhinged.

And nowhere is this more apparent and poignant than in Parasite, where a low-class family of four, down on their luck, infiltrate an upper class household, each posing as a separate helper. One is a tutor to their daughter, another a driver, and so forth. And that alone would be plenty entertaining and fascinating. Each of the four members of the Kim family are a fully realized character, brimming with personality, hopes and aspirations. Sure, what they're doing is questionable and even immoral, but the film is told from their point of view and you can't really hate them for trying to reach for those stars. It's not like they're hurting anyone. Initially. But then the story takes a turn and suddenly it's deadly serious, fiercely intense and full of high stakes and suspense. Before that twist, Parasite was already a great film, but afterwards it became a masterpiece. It also helps that Bong is a splendid director. Each scene, each shot, is measured, beautiful and poignant. The whole film look amazing, but I especially enjoyed the scenes where heavy rain is falling. Such an impactful scene. For the rich, it's just a night of rain drumming their roof. Kind of relaxing, actually. They don't have to worry about it. But for the poor, it's a night of nightmares, floods and loss. For them, it's the end of their lives as they knew it. Parasite earned it's Best Picture Oscar and I'm so glad that the Academy is finally acknowledging these foreign films. It's a film full of heavy themes, brilliant acting moments and enough content to keep you wondering for weeks. Heavily recommended."

Well, these elements are there too, but all slipped and fitted in a very intriguing and solid storyline which though starting as a light, almost comedian style plot, ends up in a bloodshed and furthermore in a very bitter truth, the realworld truth which is too hard to break free from. The film will capture your interest and attention within its first five minutes and this attention will be constantly increasing throughout its duration, a feature rather typical in this kind of stories where a rather insignificant and innocent act leads to a complicated and difficult to deal with situation like in many Cohen brothers films. Taking this in consideration one could say that the twist of this story is not that original after all, however this one, resulting in an escalating complication and a very bitter ending, is really irresistible, and certainly one of the best and most indriguing one you should expect from a movie! P.S Yesterday, global celebration of the Day of Greek language under the motto: ""Do you know you speak Greek?"". So, here's the tip of the day: Did you know that among plenty of others in your own whichever language, the title of this movie too, is actually a 100% greek word?"

Is also an ""out of the box"" movie, not for all tastes, I recommend to the audience to expect little and then you´ll be surprised by the script.

Soon all of them of are in and life is looking much rosier. Then fate throws them a curveball. Superb. Written and directed by Bong Joon Ho who gave us the superb crime-drama Memories of Murder plus the entertaining Snowpiercer, Parasite is a great mix of comedy and drama, pathos and social commentary. It starts off in very entertaining fashion as we meet the family that are experts in cons and manipulation. It is quite funny and initially they just seem like slackers. However, after a while it is quite awe-inspiring to see the work that goes into their deceptions. As the movie progresses it becomes darker and darker. The plot takes on a few surprising twists and turns and the two families involved become symbols of a class divide. The social commentary is thought-provoking without being preachy or seeming biased. Powerful ending. Solid performances round out an excellent plot and great direction."

From river monsters, to end-of-the-world tales, to a pig-like Totoro, Bong is not afraid to take seemingly popcorn concepts and work them into a smart film that has arthouse and movieplex crossover appeal. With ""Parasite"" he takes a more subtle route and tells the story of a struggling family living in a tiny basement hovel in South Korea where they have to leech off neighbors unprotected wifi and deal with nightly public urination outside their alley-side windows. When the son lands a job as a tutor for the daughter of a rich family by pretending to be a college student and lying about his resume, he spots an opportunity to recommend his sister as an art teacher for the younger brother, hiding that she's his sister and lying about her credentials as well. Next the brother and sister scheme to get the chauffeur fired so their dad can land the job and then how to fire the longtime housekeeper so their mom can snatch that opening. To tell more would spoil the fun, but I will say the film takes an unexpected turn and dramatic shift in tone. I had no idea where the film was going or how it was going to end and the ultimate ending is quite a shocker. What's most interesting about the film is asking the question, who really is the parasite? Is it the lower class family living off the rich family host or is it this privileged rich family living off the backs of their working class servants? The answer is that it could be either or most likely both. Bong's thesis appears to be that this situation of haves and have-nots coexisting is untenable and will lead to an inevitable collision course, much as it happened in his prior film ""Snowpiercer."" Bong sums it up best himself when he was described ""Parasite"" as ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains."" If I had a complaint about the film it's that the shift from humorous satire to something darker felt a bit incongruous, but Bong likely did this intentionally to bolster the film's message around the inevitable conclusion of a world of stark haves and have-nots. ""Parasite"" is a compelling film that delivers a pure cinematic experience, meaning that it's a story that could not have been told in any other medium, and is an absolute treat for cinema lovers."

It has a very good script, one which is honed with good characterization and motive, together with fine structural exposition. No other script in the 2020 Oscars has the qualities that this one has in terms of writing skill. In terms of execution, the directing and other technical components, all coalesce brilliantly. It is probably the editing too where so many remarkable films excel that lifts the film again. The sequences in the house between the families are memorable here as the tension is raised with so much at stake. The story has many layers which are relevant to this time: chiefly inequality, but also other themes too which are touched on in deft ways and through the characters so as to move the story along toward its rather terrible conclusion. The ending is somewhat classical; a purge clarifies the entire drama, and it is effective in its own terms, but it also the only part of script that is not entirely ideal. Other choices might have been made which do not make the one we see an error. Signalling 'wokeness' is pointless with this film. It is a very good film and will be referenced by film makers and students for years to come. That durability is honor indeed."

The movie follows a continuity of speed and all the way keeps the humour intact. The dark satirical comedy which is funny but after every laugh it also pins a thought about the actual darkness which creates the humour and it lingers for sometime. A movie for all genre lovers.

Indeed, this balance between light and dark is probably its best aspect. The piece delivers moments of humour alongside moments of horror, each as genuine as the other. It's always entertaining, whether comedic or unsettling, and it's very well-made, to boot. Interestingly, the focal family aren't really all that empathetic once they start taking things a little too far, attempting to usurp the innocent and hard-working staff of the rich family they're 'scamming'. This isn't really detrimental, though. It's a distinct decision meant to keep us questioning who is really in the right, no matter whose perspective we're in. What it also does, however, is somewhat dampen the impact of the picture's proposed theme. Its comments on class perhaps don't quite come full circle - at least, not in the way you'd expect. Another issue is the fact that the initial protagonist sort of gets lost once his family moves further into the picture, but this isn't detrimental as the flick plays out in an ensemble fashion and the initial lead still gets a decent amount to do. Each member of the focal family has a decisive personality and their dynamic is believable. For me, the movie's second half - marked by its biggest tonal shift - isn't necessarily as successful as the first, despite it being the 'real beginning' according to director Bong Joon Ho. Of course, the film is always compelling. It's astutely crafted, too. Despite a few issues, it's an entertaining experience throughout. It's fantastic. 9/10."

Unpredictably composed, Parasite effortlessly shifts between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in a deep breath, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, those inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows. The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways.

Parasite has already received numerous accolades, with six nominations at the 92nd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best International Feature Film, making it the first South Korean film to receive Academy Award recognition. At the 77th Golden Globe Awards, the film won the award for Best Foreign Language Film. It received four nominations at the 73rd British Academy Film Awards. It also became the first non-English film to win the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture. The film's title ""Parasite"" was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said ""Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that Parasite refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant. But if you look at it the other way, you can say that rich family, they're also parasites in terms of labor. They can't even wash dishes, they can't drive themselves, so they leech off the poor family's labor. So both are parasites."" I read Director and script writer Bong Joon is a great admirer of Alfred Hitchcock and I'm sure Hitch would praise this movie even the music score is reminiscent of Hitchcock films . The film makes several nods to Alfred Hitchcock throughout. Stairs are used as a motif, voyeurism is used as characters watch scenes through windows 14 times, and (most obviously) there is a brief glimpse of an out of place Alfred Hitchcock collection in the Park's home. I thought it also reminded me of Quentin Tarantino in its dark comedy and there are some very funny moments especially in the first half of this unique and original film. Unfortunately I've only seen Parasite on DVD but I hope to see it again on a Cinema Screen soon. It's a movie I want to watch again as it's as good as all the hype it's getting and what a journey! it takes the audience on. Described as a Black Comedy Thriller as of 2/2/20 this film had grossed a Worldwide $163.3 million and was estimated to have cost $11 million to produce. Of course I don't know any of the actors but they're all terrific in their roles and as an ensemble cast one of the best this year ."

IN BRIEF: Brilliantly directed, Parasite is a dark satire about class warfare that burrows into your moviegoing pleasure and doesn't let go. JIM'S REVIEW: Korean director Bong Joon-ho is a very versatile talent whose work is always visionary and highly personal, but not always successful due to his penchant for overstatement. His film subjects most always deal with social issues and oppressive forces against the common man. Yet, his films can range to a host of genres, from horror film to surreal sci-fi to political satire. One cannot easily pigeonhole this director and even his lesser films which become borderline contrived, still contain powerful messages about greed, consumerism, and class struggles. Parasite may be his best film to date. It is a thrilling and complicated tale that keeps the moviegoer guessing its outcome. The film starts out as a dark comedy, then suddenly veers into pure satire before finishing its journey as a crime story. It is an exhilarating ride. Dare I say, very twisted, metaphorically speaking. The literate screenplay by Han Jin-won and co-authored by the director contrasts two Korean families: the Kims, a clan of poor grifters living in squalor in a sub-basement apartment doing menial low-paying jobs just to get by, and the Parks, an affluent and dysfunctional family that take their wealth unwisely for granted. The Kims' work their way into the Parks' lives through their lies and deceptive action, all resulting in tragic events. The script cleverly weaves The Kims' greedy scheming against the Parks' naivety and shallowness to a crescendo of mayhem and violence. The film does have one too many anti-climatic endings and needed a bit more concise storytelling for stronger impact, but Bong Joon-ho masterfully conveys his raging vision of the working class and the elite at war. The cast is wonderful. Song Kang-ho is the impoverished patriarch and Jang Hye-jin is his shrewish wife. Choi Woo-shik is their idealistic son and Park So-dam is their wily daughter. They battle Lee Sun-kyan as a haughty businessman and Cho Yeo-jeong, in a scene-stealing role, as his fragile and dim wife. Strong production values reinforce the sharp divide between the classes. Visually, the dirty and cramped cluttered apartment contrasts dramatically with the sunlit contemporary Architectural Digest prototypes created by designer Ha-jun Lee."

And for good reason, this was simply just great movie making! It has so many elements such as comedy, drama, and hold your breath suspense. And a very original story. While watching, my wife stated this almost seems like a much better version of Jordan Peele's 'Us', which I would agree with. I feel like both movies try to deliver the same message, though Parasite is far superior in doing so. This was satire at its finest as the film looks at two very different families, one being rich, and the other being poor. These two social classes will clash, but just as you think to have it all figured out, a huge wrench is thrown into the plot and it goes from crazy to ludicrous. The tension is huge throughout because you don't even know who you're cheering for. There's no defined bad guys or good guys, all have their qualities you commend, but also flaws. Every character is beautifully acted as well. Not at any time was I bored. The characters and story lock your attention up, while you wait in anticipation on how this whole wild ""situation"" will turn out."

Regardless of how well the film was made, how good the acting was, and how the twist worked to serve the story... I HATED SE7EN. And while I don't necessarily hate PARASITE, I'm quite certain I'm not going to be rushing to see it again, nor will I be adding it to any library of movies I might have. It starts out with a family of have-nothings getting inter wrapped with a family of have-everythings, at first in the vein of comedy. There's a dark thread that runs through each step the Kim family takes as they get more and more involved with the Park family, their house, and their valuables, but for the majority of the first two acts of the film, the general levity is well kept. You play along, wanting to see what will happen next. But then, there's a twist, one that ends the comedy in a single strike. The Kim family, whom we don't necessarily support in their actions but try to find reasons to accept why they choose to do to the Park family what they do, suddenly raise the bar on their pursuits, at the cost of any level of ethics. The humor is, at a single point in the movie, lost forever, leaving us only with the same vein of horror that one might have found watching SE7EN, which is why I brought that film up in the first place. Where you might have started the film smiling, you spend the end of the movie battling a kind of nausea, as the characters change from semi-decent misunderstood people (on both sides of the spectrum) into NOT so decent people (on both sides of the spectrum). I have to give chops where chops are due. Bong Joon Ho masterfully directs this film, from the choice of lighting and shots to the actors chosen for their performances and the extreme conditions that they are put through to really make the point of this film stand out. And in truth, the point that is trying to be made here IS the reason to watch this movie, and in that regard it is a success. Once you've seen PARASITE, it may be a long time before you forget about it, and maybe it will give you some interesting food for thought, as it did me. You've never looked at the world through a lens like this, I promise you. So, just like SE7EN, nobody pulls their punches here. Everyone delivers a damn good performance."

This makes Parasite (South Korean 2019 tragicomedy) a must-see movie. Having just come out of the theatre, I can admit in all sincerity that the film has affected me on multiple levels. But before broaching the poignant essentials, should firstly dispense with the banal, which I expect the woke and self-righteous movie-goers are likely to focus on. These will undoubtedly include such predictable clichés as injustices of income inequality, disdain of the chauffeur-driven elite towards ""smelly"" subway riders, aloof callousness to the upper classes, etc. These elements are undeniably featured in the film, but purely as a foil for a deeper exploration of the human psyche, which deserves to be examined with some specificity. Viewer warning: Parasite, while a monumental piece of cinematic work, is not a joyous viewing experience. The unrelenting intensity, unleashed on the viewer almost from the start (not too dissimilar to that of observing a circus acrobat on a tight rope without the safety net), is sustained without respite throughout the two-hour-plus duration. Armed with only a cursory knowledge of the South Korean society, culture, and class hierarchy, I felt somewhat disadvantaged, particularly during the early scenes. At the risk of being exceedingly presumptuous, I fear that most of the US movie-going public might be in the same boat, despite the prominence of the ubiquitous Samsung, KIA Motors and other Korean brands permeating global markets. If not for the omnipresent media denunciations of its dangerously unpredictable neighbor to the north, we would probably know even less about the Region. While ignorance is generally considered to be a bliss, in the case of Parasite, not knowing the Korean societal dynamics, one can't help but experience the frustrations of cognitive dissonance right from the start. On the one hand, we are presented with: While on the other hand: The initial culturally ""foreign"" element driving the dissonance is that despite the unambiguously self-reliant and skilled family members, the mother feels she needs to kick the husband out of his slumber to ""come up with the plan"". An accomplished hammer-thrower evidently needs a man to do the heavy lifting (pun intended) when it comes to figuring out options for protecting the family or improving its finances."

This movie feels like it's moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows. There isn't a dull moment to it, you're either on edge or learning more about it's well-defined characters. Each is distinct and so well performed. I recognized Korean-Canadian actor Woo-sik Choi from ""Train to Busan"" (he's looking fine in this too btw XD) as the brother Ki-Woo. I may be biased because I've grown to really like seeing him, but he was my favorite character in this film. I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father. Really well done, applause to you sir! I loved seeing the scheming involved in this, with a name like ""Parasite"" I thought this was going to be sci-fi in nature. But it's not at all! It's more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives. The Kim family were some sneaky ba****** let me tell you and I loved it! It's like a better version of Ocean's films (sorry fans of that series), but with less heisting and more actual manual labour. But still a lot of deception, showing class division without making the rich too ""villain-like"". So seeing as the story/screenplay was superb, it's of course coupled with great camerawork/visual representations and an on-point soundtrack to back it up. There's some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don't have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon-fed information. Which I appreciate a lot! I'm so glad this film had a U.S. release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles...that would be tragic! I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest! This by far is one of the best films of 2019. It's thrilling, funny, tragic and very very intelligent. Please watch it if you haven't! I'm definitely going to have to check out more from the director/co-writer because he's impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft. I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general, this is exactly why."

A vicious black comedy, it tells the story of an impoverished family who think they've found a meal-ticket for life when they manage to displace the servants of a gullable rich one; but it turns out they're not the only desparate people in town. Everyone can enjoy its ingenious plot and wonderful sense of aesthetic; but at heart, this is a serious film about how both wealth and poverty corrupt the soul. As such, it has no heroes; and its victims are either not innocent, or, if they are, have no right to be. There's no question it deserved it's awards."

It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre."

That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own. The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances. It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts. However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."

As expected from a Bong Joon-ho film, the tone boldly changes at will (mostly between hysterical satire and nerve-wracking thriller), but the transitions are more fluid than ever before for the talented filmmaker--or perhaps it's just because the story and technique is so gripping. Meticulously designed and flawlessly performed by its cast (the first foreign-language group to ever score the ensemble cast award from the Screen Actors Guild), its audacious tangle of ideas and statements packaged with artful, precise elegance. Some of the metaphors come off as shopworn in their exactness, but the film is so otherwise ingeniously constructed that it takes effort to recall in the aftermath exactly how the incidents all piled up. Amusing scriptwriting workshop exercise idea: present the first twenty minutes and last twenty minutes of the movie and see how someone tries to navigate a connection between the endpoints. 91/100"

Plus, it's unpredictable genre-mixing entertainment otherwise. That's not to say the social commentary isn't obvious, though, and rather nihilistic. There's ambiguity and complications as to which characters are the ""parasites."" While one suspects that our sympathies are supposed to be with the lower-class Kim family, they are the ones conning the upper-class Parks. In one sequence, to deter detection, they even hide, crawl and slither about like the insects that infest their own home. But, then, the Parks often come across as a vacuous family of privilege who tend to hold their employees in contempt. In effect, they're all parasites--even the former workers that the Kims replace by tricking the Parks into firing them. Every major character tries to exploit or debase others in some way or another. The Kims get others fired, forge their own qualifications and take advantage of the Parks' trust. Conversely, the Park parents mock the smell of Kim Ki-taek, and they pretend to be slumming it for sex roleplay. Their daughter is more interested in her tutor as a boyfriend instead of as hired help, and even the young son misinterprets a cry for help in Morse code and is a fan for the cultural appropriation of Native Americans. The only other Bong Joon-ho movie that I've seen thus far, ""Snowpiercer"" (2013) is more heavy-handed in its depiction of class. In it, the rich exploit the poor; it's as straightforward as the continuously-running train. ""Parasite"" is more steeply layered. The upstairs-downstairs class stratification is reflected in Seoul's geography. The Kims live in a semi-basement in a crowded urban area. We only ever see them arrive home by descending stairs, whereas they ascend them to work for the Parks in their luxurious suburban estate with a backyard. While it rains at the Park's home, that of the Kims is also flooded by sewage, including feces raining on them from the toilet. A drunk urinates outside their window and even tries to literally piss on them at one point. Others of poverty turn out to inhabit spaces even lower--in a hidden bomb shelter below another flight of stairs. This further references the larger line of demarcation separating North and South Korea, which itself mirrors Mr."

Based on a screenplay by Han Jin-won and Bong Joon-ho, it is a quirky, yet surprisingly well-made romp that could only come from somewhere like Korea. In Seoul, the unemployed Kim family, led by Ki-taek, his wife Choong-sook, son Ki-woo, and daughter Ki-jeong try to get by in their cramped basement apartment. One day, Ki-woo's friend suggests to him that he take over as a tutor for the daughter of the rich Park family while he travels abroad. Over time, the rest of the Kim family start taking jobs offered to them by the Parks at their large mansion while masquerading under fake names so as not to give away that the four of them are related and eventually start to reap the benefits of the Park's swanky lifestyle. With its unique Korean style, Parasite has just the right balance between dark comedy and family drama that it never bores its audience. It's just so much fun seeing how each member of the Kim family were adjusting to their new lavish ways in a house that doesn't even belong to them. This feels like a commentary on societal class in Korea, in how each citizen likely has their own perspective on how to live in the moment. Even better is the ending, which I will not spoil, but what I will say is that it concludes the story in the best way possible. If you watch one Korean movie this year, make it this one."

Both parents are unemployed, and the children did not continue their education. They all lived in a basement room, but then suddenly it was like heaven had given a big blessing to this family. When the eldest brother's friend has to study abroad, So he entrusted him to teach English to a rich man's daughter. However, this apparent stroke of luck eventually leads to unforeseen disaster. And this is the first movie in 92 years of the Oscars to be the winner of this award. It is a non-English-language film. It's undeniable this movie is famous and popularity because of the outstanding cinematography and unforgettable characters. First of all, I will talk about the best scenes that impressed and fascinated me while watching this movie. The scene of walking down the stairs to return to the Mouse Hole home while it rains occurs after the Parasitic family has to escape from the paradise they have only recently enjoyed. The Kim family ran home to save as much of their belongings as possible. After watching that scene made me feel like it reflects society that rich people are at a high point and can take the heart of a crisis, but poor people must overcome their own obstacles. Then, during the conversation with the lady during a phone call, she talked about something that made Kim Ki Taek stop. This is another scene that makes me feel that no matter what class or society you belong to, you will be criticized, looked down on, oppressed, and cynical by someone higher than you anyway. While all the actors in the film deserve praise for their performances, Kim Ki Taek's character, portrayed by Song Kang Ho stands out of the narrative. I really love him because, he is the main characters that makes the story fun, hilarious, tense, and thrilling at the same time. He made the story colorful and not too stressful. I agree that some characters may detract from the main plot. Therefore, time doesn't seem fluid and it takes time to watch it several times to understand that point. Transitioning to the architectural symbolism employed by the creator. The stark class divide is clearly expressed in the design of the Park family's home It has a raised entrance and clearly delineated glass edges. This suggests that the production is highlighting socio-economic differences. To reinforce the main issue of inequality."

In a lot of ways this movie reminded me of Better Call Saul's early seasons, with the elaborate schemes that unravel while the viewer watches. The start of the movie has a very positive tone along with it. Speaking of tone that's probably what the movie does best, taking the light hearted cheerful tone and slowly over the course of the two hours slowly getting darker until the ending. Although the last minutes of runtime after the big ending scene I didn't care for too much myself, felt like it brought it back up from the grim ending back to the starts tone a tad too quickly to me."

The movie has this soft tension build up all throughout story progression and never really settles down on one tone. Shortly after the start you kind of get the idea where things go, but you have no clue what is going to happen after that and how the protagonists are going to deal with the difficulties they are facing. The script was very cleverly written, makes you face a decision who you are rooting for. I could sympathize with either the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys"" at any given point during the movie. This movie should be a great example to Hollywood how to write and direct an original title, this is a Korean gem that will go down as one of the best in its genre and category."

The South Korean setting really emphasizes the themes also, especially from a westerner's perspective like mine! Complementing these ideas portrayed, the editing and cinematography reinforces the extreme financial differences between the two families. The main house setting becomes almost like its own character within the film. It is modern but also has an undercurrent of isolation, which supports a reveal later in the narrative. All of the performances were phenomenal. As the tensions begin to rise, we can see the clear desperation of the main family. I do not think I could predict anything that was going to happen in the narrative past a certain point. Additionally, the ending of the film is one of the best I have seen in quite a while. Overall, I would highly recommend this Best Picture Winner! The tension builds throughout to an amazing finale, which is definitely worth seeing for yourself."

The films follow a struggling family, the Kims, and their climb to fortune through working for a wealthy family, the Parks. Bong Joon-ho et al.'s fastidious composition of every frame, consistent symbolism, and contrasting color grading leave no doubt as to how Parasite garnered the 2020 Academy Awards for Best Picture, and several other nominations and wins. The film's ending, fresh and unexpected, never felt out of place as the subtleties of carefully placed details throughout the film foreshadow the ending's twist. The gifted stone, speculated to bring wealth, only brought corruption and misfortune; The bright red sauce splashed onto pizza foreshadowed the fatal consequences of the schemes crafted; The line that must never be crossed- except when one character does, all subconsciously produced the perfect atmosphere of the foreboding implication of something terrible to come. The contrast of the darkness of the Kim's downstairs world to the Park's airy, bright, and naturally lit atmosphere forces the audience to reflect on their interpretation of class. As we watch the endings of each character, we have to wonder if they got what they deserved. How we feel about them forces us to confront our values- to many, this led to the feeling of discomfort and that the film was too 'odd'. The constant artificial lighting and dark grading of the downstairs world remind us of the Kim's goals to worm their way up in search of light. As Joon-ho's morally gray characters climb up the stairs or driveway, they reflect the inherent societal desires for wealth and the strive to achieve it. Joon-ho uses separate upstairs and downstairs worlds to supplement the film's message rather than to become the premise of it. This allows a fresher and freer interpretation of class struggle rather than recycling through past examples of this familiar piece of symbolism for class struggle. The character's journey of climbing up becomes another one of the film's several subtleties."

The portrayal of a caste system is jarring and near horrifying as the citizens of South Korea slide into their roles as they've been trained to all their lives. Until the Kim family begins to literally feed off the rich Park family, that is. It starts out pretty harmless as a scheme to get the Kim family into household jobs is put in place. It takes a little bit to get this accomplished but it looks like things are improving for the impoverished family. However, no one expected one of the displaced former servants to return while the Park family is out for their son's birthday weekend. This. Gets. Dark. Fast. It's interesting to see how the Korean culture has their system so ingrained that the rich won't even consider hiring the poor unless their business cards are pristine, or the owner of the agency vouches for their experience catering to the wealthy. It's sickening how nonchalantly the Park patriarch acts around this. But our parasitic family seizes on character flaws so quickly, nobody seems to catch on. The film morphs into a suspense thriller so fast your heads will spin. I did not see that ending coming, at all. The parasitic infestation metaphor is so on the nose that there is even an insect extermination near the beginning. The film could also have been titled symbiotic as the rich feed off the poor just as much, though more comfortably. The balance between the two needs to be maintained or, well, you'll see. It's been a long time since I've seen a psychological thriller mixed with social commentary get so many accolades but they are well deserved."

When you think they are already miserable enough, the movie suddenly turns around: they are not the worst yet, there are even worse ones. If you are rich, there must be someone richer than you; If you are poor, there must be someone even poorer than you. The wealth gap is like countless walls, dividing people into different classes. This wall stands tall even in the wind, sun, and rain, without moving a trace.

The themes of the movie are subtly weaved into the action, resulting in a thought-provoking and emotionally stirring viewing experience. I would unquestionably give this film 4.5 stars out of 5. My understanding of ""Parasite"" is consistent with the majority of the positive reviews the movie has gotten, including its several Academy Award nominations and Cannes Film Festival Palme d'Or award. However, I felt that some reviews overemphasized the social commentary of the film while ignoring its technical and artistic accomplishments. For instance, The Guardian's favorable review hails the movie's ""biting satire"" but just briefly highlights its superb photography and sound editing. Even though I acknowledge the value of the social critique, I think ""Parasite"" should be viewed as a whole cinematic endeavor. The movie also has remarkable technical qualities. The script strikes the ideal balance between drama and humor, and the prose is snappy and funny. Each performer gives a nuanced and believable role, and the acting is excellent."

Metaphorically and figuratively, Ki Tae's family live below the ground of the haves. Their toilet is even higher than their dwelling ground. This is how poor they are. They struggle to barely crawl up to the surface of economic adequacy, resorting to scams and deceptions, scrapping to make ends meet. The seeming victims are the Parks, a well to do family enveloped in the world of luxury and complacency. Much of the depictions of Ki Tae's family members would initially make the audience think of how despicable they are. While the parks are portrayed to be adequately tolerant of the underprivileged as long as their life is not in any way imposed. Slowly but surely the movie unravels. The subtext of hopelessness of classism soon reveals itself, mixed in with a very well thought out plot twists. 'Parasites' shows a world where the underprivileged are too wrapped in their own survival to recognize the trap they are in while the privileged are too busy meandering the labyrinth of western luxury. One of the best movies ever crafted for sure."

Then one evening I decided to see if this film is really a masterpiece as everyone says or if it is just an extremely overrated film. Well, there are no other possibilities, this film is just a masterpiece. This film surprised me a lot! The characters are sensational: very interesting, well characterized, excellently interpreted. There is not one character that I liked much more than the others, but if I have to mention a few, these are Kim and Ki-Jung. The actors are extraordinary, each one left something inside me. The setting is phenomenal, from the first image you understand perfectly the economic and family situation of the Ki-taek family and then also that of the Park family.

I really liked the drastic change of emotions during the film: it goes from fun and tranquility to tension and anxiety with a scene, extraordinary. Bong Joon-ho's direction is fabulous and in fact it deserved the Oscar. Every award won by this film is extremely deserved. I really liked the choice of objects and the settings that always come back during the film. The ending of the film is incredible, I would never have expected such a turn in a film that seemed highly quiet. I have no other arguments to describe more about what this film represents in the cinema. Indescribable. I can't wait to see it again. . Rating: 10/10."

It wasn't for everyone, though. Both films are 'so metaphorical' as ""Parasite"" protagonist Kim Ki-woo likes to put it. But different strokes for different people, no? Certainly, the metaphors aren't on vacation this time around, it's just that they learned to profess some subtlety. As back then, Bong pulls out all the stops in ""Parasite,"" and while the former picture's literally Godzillish rendition matching its ambitions makes it borderline, the new approach is hard to skip. It takes on the shape of a pitch-dark comedy with coarse edges when it counts. One might as well let one's self get immersed in it, enjoy the ride and laugh along, relish its twists and turns before receiving a blow from left field. ""Parasite"" comes across as less pretentious, settles on the more down-to-earth (pun intended) side of things; it plants its seed with a much smaller dose of horror, is whimsical, ironic, even cynic at times; and it substitutes CGI for clever story-telling and cinematography measuring the highs and lows of the social ladder with visual precision. In short, ingredients for a less in-your-face, decisively creeping-up-on-you kind of comedy drama of caliber, falling into line with Bong's other early outstanding effort ""Memories of Murder."" ""Parasite"" is an all-out visual genre mix of the first order, as much commentary about western society's underbelly and upper class as it is a ghost story drawing from a long Asian tradition. Things are in play that have always been lingering deep down underneath and come back to haunt us, metaphorically - and literally. In that sense the film is as much a thriller as it is fun stuff and dead serious drama, a bit like an attempt at squaring a circle, and yet it works. ""Parasite"" is also the ultimate staircase film, to name just one striking image. This owes itself to the implied fairy-tale lore that at the end of the staircase - society's equivalent for the romantic rainbow - you'll find a pot of gold, right? It's just that stairs work in both directions, and climbing them up or down is less romantic. Bong Joon Ho makes staircase construction his art and builds them vicious circle-like. Consider this circle squared."

However, more secrets are revealed sooner or later behind the kindness and generosity of everyone in the Pak family's house and among their employees. I'll try to keep everything laconically. The movie gives a viewer a glimpse of a wonderful director's work. I really liked how Mr. Bong Joon-ho chose the angles and points of view in this story. Considering that the movie is a thriller, a drama, and particularly a horror, the camera ""flows"" and moves in a way that calms down the viewer and lets him/her dive into the film. It is also significant to mention that the way suspense was kept and increased was special. The viewer doesn't understand the concept in the beginning, but closer to the end, the curtain is moved apart. I recommend that you pay close attention to the majority of the scenes because there are some hidden clues and social problems in South Korea presented. One example is the social inequality between the rich and the poor and how inhumane people can behave toward each other. Lastly, the movie is special in the way it shows the differences in how people think about and contemplate their own lives. For instance, being rich doesn't always mean being smart. Moreover, the movie will definitely make your emotions ""mix."" To clarify, some scenes can be considered funny, others are heart-touching and scary. Do not prepare for something monotonous. One thing that made me dissatisfied was the ending. I won't implement any detailed spoilers, so don't worry. However, the ending totally twisted the way I personally looked at the main character and the story itself. It suddenly turned from a suspenseful drama to a massacre, which, from my point of view, didn't give the story more ""color."". To conclude shortly, I truly recommend this movie for those who seek a worthy thriller with a story twist and an unexpected ending. Therefore, it doesn't concern those who watch with great attention to details :) Believe me, clues and details will bring you to your destination much faster. Thank you for reading my review!

From the very first scene, it pulls you into its world, making you feel as though you're part of the story, almost like an unseen member of the family. This sense of immersion is both comforting and unsettling, as the film masterfully balances moments of warmth with underlying tension. What I find particularly captivating is the seamless integration of Korean cultural influences. The film doesn't just tell a universal story-it tells a distinctly Korean one, yet its themes of class disparity, family dynamics, and ambition resonate across cultures. This authenticity gives the movie a unique flavor, adding layers of meaning that feel both specific and relatable. The concept of the film is deceptively simple yet undeniably brilliant. It explores the lives of two families from vastly different social classes, weaving their interactions into a narrative that is as entertaining as it is thought-provoking. The storytelling is meticulous, with every detail serving a purpose. Just when you think you understand where the story is headed, the plot takes a turn so shocking and profound that it reframes everything that came before. The plot twist is executed flawlessly, tying the threads of the story together in a way that is both unexpected and deeply satisfying. Beyond its gripping narrative, the film excels in its technical aspects. The cinematography is stunning, using visual metaphors and clever framing to underscore its themes. The performances are exceptional, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their roles. The writing, direction, and pacing all work in harmony to create a cinematic experience that is as entertaining as it is emotionally resonant. This is a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll. It challenges you to think, to feel, and to see the world through a different lens. Parasite isn't just a movie-it's an experience, and one that I know will stay with me for a very long time."

Let me tell you, the movie impressed me. It was shot very cool, stylish and spectacular. I almost got claustrophobic after some scenes. BUT, it was very, very unpleasant for me to watch everything that happened on the screen. This is a scenario of survival in severe conditions. Where morality fades into the background and a dry calculation remains. Everything revolves around money. Money turns people. It's a wonderful, multi-layered film. The left-leaning director boldly satirizes referral jobs, Koreans' love of loans, tutors, elite universities, goods ordered from America, and even the peculiar smell in the Seoul subway. There are no unambiguously positive characters here: the poor, parasitizing on the gullible, spoiled and arrogant rich, do not cause much sympathy. ""Parasite"", however, is revealed in different ways: at first it is a picaresque comedy, then it turns into satire, then - almost a serious piece - it's just a farce, with elements of a thriller or even horror. But in the end, everything turns into the total seriousness and injustice of the very structure of things, disappointment in a capitalist society - which adds the necessary energy to this farce. Everything ends with a cold waterfall, which refreshes and makes you think about important things. Music, beautiful interiors, bright characters, camera work, lively atmosphere and thirst for profit make this film a serious challenge to yourself and makes you ask yourself the question: 'Are you a parasite?'"

The poor but cunning Kim family infiltrates the rich Park family through a series of deceptions, as the Kims discredit the previous domestic workers to replace them one by one, fabricating fake credentials. However, the Park house hides a dark secret which throws the Kims' plan into chaos. To say more would be a shame. This is, for me, Bong's best movie since The Host, possibly even since Memories of Murder, boasting perfect editing, fine performances (the great Kang-ho Song, Bong's long-time collaborator, plays the patriarch of the poor family) and clever visual storytelling. The attention to details is stunning: the film has a strong vertical structure, with the road to the Parks house ascending into the sunlight while the journey back to the Kims' basement is a long, dim descent; the two great windows of the houses contrast each other, with the Parks' showing a gorgeous garden and the Kims' a squalid alley populated by drunkards; when a Native Americans-themed birthday turns into something far more sinister, a character's face is smeared with blood in a way to resemble war paintings. The script is worthy of these remarkable visuals and finds a miraculous balance between comedy, tragedy and tension. 8,5/10"

This movie got me looking into Korean cinema and what a country of rich story tellers and new styles in film making. Distrust of wealth and authority. What we brutally see is a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper. A family who works for the wealthy family decide to move in as if this home where there own. For me, Parasite is best described as a melancholy ghost story, albeit one disguised beneath umpteen layers of superbly designed (and impeccably photographed) generic mutations. Thrillingly played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and co-writer Han Jin-won's multitonal script, it's a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul."

Even though it's a Korean film, the themes hit universally, so it's no surprise it took home Best Picture at the Oscars. There's a sharpness to how it explores class divides and human nature that feels both raw and relatable, no matter where you're from. What strikes me again is just how spot-on everything is-from the casting to the writing to the direction. Each performance is layered and feels lived-in, with every actor bringing out the subtleties of their character's motivations. I find myself really appreciating the way Bong Joon-ho pulls it all together, balancing tension, drama, and satire so seamlessly. It's a masterclass in storytelling, no doubt. However, there's one aspect that still doesn't quite click with me: the comedy. For all its brilliance, the humour feels a bit off and manufactured at times, pulling me out of the film's world. I know it's part of Bong's signature style, but it doesn't land as naturally as the rest of the film's elements. Maybe it's because I've become more familiar with his approach, so what might have felt groundbreaking for others comes across as more expected to me. That's not to say it's not an amazingly good film-it absolutely is. But having watched Shoplifters from 2018, which touches on some similar themes, Parasite feels slightly less fresh to me. It's still a powerhouse of a film, just not quite the 10/10 that others might find it to be. Even with that minor gripe, Parasite remains a compelling watch. It's visually striking, tightly constructed, and full of moments that stick with me long after the credits roll. For anyone who hasn't seen it-or even those revisiting-it's a damned good film that more than earns its place as a modern classic.

It's a film about class structure, greed, selfishness, criminality, liars, the spoiled, love, envy and more.

It's a film of three halves, part Roma, part French comedy of errors, part Shakespearean tragedy. The Roma elements introduced us to Korean culture which was a refreshing insight to lifestyles I knew nothing about. The comedy of errors elements are genuinely funny and very well scripted, with sass and wit and portrayed and directed with excellent timing. The tragedy is shocking but never out of kilter with the rest of the film (I'll say no more in case of spoilers, suffice to say, it somewhat vindicated my earlier reluctance to watch the film, but I am extremely glad I overcame that reluctance.).

Finally I can only say that everyone must see this movie before they die."

This South Korean masterpiece embarks on an exploration of class divide, encapsulating a myriad of emotions and social commentaries in its tightly-knit plot. The film's narrative structure is a testament to Bong's storytelling prowess. It begins with a sense of light-hearted mischief, following the Kim family as they ingeniously embed themselves into the lives of the wealthy Park family. However, the movie's tone shifts gradually, descending into a darker, more introspective territory. The pacing is impeccable, ensuring that each scene seamlessly leads to the next, while maintaining a suspenseful atmosphere that grips the audience. Thematically, ""Parasite"" delves deep into the realms of social inequality and class warfare. It is a poignant reflection on the vast chasm between the wealthy and the impoverished, told through a lens that is both satirical and tragic. The film does not shy away from showcasing the brutal realities of socio-economic disparities, yet it manages to do so without being preachy. Instead, it presents these themes through the interactions and transformations of its well-rounded characters. Technically, the film is a marvel. The cinematography is stunning, with each frame meticulously crafted to enhance the storytelling. The use of space, particularly in the contrasting depictions of the Kim's cramped semi-basement and the Park's sprawling mansion, visually reinforces the theme of class divide. The score is subtly haunting, underscoring the tension and adding layers to the film's atmosphere. On a personal note, ""Parasite"" resonated with me deeply. It is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, urging you to reflect on the societal structures we live within. Bong Joon-ho's direction is not just entertaining; it's thought-provoking, presenting a mirror to our world in a way that is both unsettling and necessary. In conclusion, ""Parasite"" is a cinematic gem that defies genre conventions. It's a story about human beings and their complex, often troubled relationships with each other and the society they inhabit. The film's ability to balance humor, suspense, and social commentary is nothing short of remarkable, making it a must-watch for anyone who appreciates the power of cinema to evoke, engage, and enlighten."

Although the plot that reflects social inequality might make it feel hard to understand, the movie is presented simply and straightforwardly. I love that the movie takes the issue of social inequality to the core of the story. The film runs by asking us to ask questions in our minds throughout the story: who is the real ""parasite class""? The rich or the poor? Or do we all have parasites inside ourselves? The film clearly shows the main point of the story from character quotes, character actions and symbolic expressions. More than that, in terms of production, it is good as well. Every point of view, color grading, or even sound effects are meaningful and exciting which make the audience more involved with the movie even more. In the first part of the story, the story begins gradually, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters mixed with black comedy that reflects the social system of inequality. But at the end of the story runs in a different direction from the first. There is something more exciting and thrilling. Overall, it's still a really great movie and a really good script. Because the movie takes on heavy issues such as class and social inequality to make it more understandable. At the end of the story the audiences can answer the questions that the villain of the story is not the poor or the rich, but the social inequality that makes people be a villain."

The director of 'The Host' and 'Snowpiercer' is no stranger to genre gymnastics, and here he tells the story of a poor Seoul family infiltrating the lives of a super-rich household through suspense, drama, laughs and farce, allowing moments of pure terror, quiet observation and baroque noise to sit happily alongside each other. It never jars as it glides from one state of being to the next. The appeal of 'Parasite' is simple and age-old: inequality, class, manners and how we behave to protect what's ours, or to gain that which we believe should be ours."

Very interesting and for me a little unusual movie. It evakes emotions (mainly negative) but it doesn't mean to be bad. In my opinion art is about evoking emotions (no matter what kind of). So in this perspective this movie is all about art.

This South Korean film took the world by storm in 2019, winning the Palme d'Or at Cannes and ultimately the Academy Award for Best Picture. Its universal themes of class struggle, social inequality, and the human condition resonate across cultural boundaries, making it a truly global cinematic experience. The film tells the story of the Kim family, a lower-class household struggling to make ends meet, who ingeniously embed themselves into the lives of the wealthy Park family. The ensemble cast, including Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, and Jang Hye-jin, delivers performances that are both nuanced and compelling, capturing the desperation, cunning, and ultimately the tragedy of the characters. Bong Joon-ho's direction is impeccable. He crafts a narrative that is both tight and layered, shifting seamlessly between moments of humor, tension, and heartbreak. The film's tone changes effortlessly, keeping the audience engaged and constantly on their toes. ""Parasite"" is visually stunning, with meticulous production design and cinematography that contrast the starkly different worlds of the rich and the poor. The Park family's luxurious, architecturally designed home, a character in its own right, is a stark contrast to the cramped, semi-basement apartment where the Kim family resides. This visual dichotomy powerfully underscores the film's exploration of class disparity. The screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, is smart, witty, and deeply insightful. The film doesn't just depict the divide between the wealthy and the poor; it delves into the complexities and nuances of this divide, presenting a layered and multifaceted view of societal structure. The pacing of ""Parasite"" is another of its strengths. The film builds tension slowly, with each scene adding to the narrative's momentum, leading to an explosive and thought-provoking climax. The twists and turns of the plot are unpredictable yet entirely plausible, making the story's conclusion both shocking and deeply satisfying. One of the most remarkable aspects of ""Parasite"" is its ability to blend genres. It's a film that cannot be easily categorized, as it weaves elements of drama, comedy, and thriller into a unique and cohesive whole. The film's only minor drawback might be its accessibility to those unfamiliar with Korean culture and society, as some nuances may be lost in translation."

Great Message. Gripping Drama. The film portrays two a whole different families in the context of class. One immensely rich and the other profoundly poor. The main storyline is based on the parasitic methods which the other family uses to make its daily livings. As my headline suggests, Bong Joon-ho has not missed the point on to which extent people can go to make their livelihood when they are poor. He has recklessly showed the gap between the rich and the poor. Poverty is an undoubtedly established and entrenched problem of the society but over the time people have gained modern tactics to deal with it, as shown in the film. Whether it is the Kim family or the Park family, acting is done significantly by both. Kims flawlessly played the role of a poor family who are smart enough and ready to fool anyone to make their sustenance. Parks perfectly played the role of a rich family who are decent and ignorant enough to be fooled. Every scene in the movie has shown the gap which has widened enough. The gripping drama is the main masterpiece covered by Bong Joon-ho. Lastly, this film will leave you thinking about its acting, plot and social message"

In many ways, Parasite starts more like a comedy-a rather typical film that some may even describe as normal but: it is in the second quarter when after the Kim family and Park family have become acquainted, that the movie begins to live up to its title: ""Parasite."" The film was developed in such a beautiful manner that throughout the entire film; I found myself constantly guessing what will happen next but; I was always happy to be wrong. When I think of Parasite, I think of the sheer variety within its themes and how calling it a: ""Thriller/Comedy"" does not do it justice. Whether it was the unsettling tune that played at the weirdest of times or the thought behind every shot, the entire movie had me convinced that it was going to be like nothing else. Parasite leaves us with a rather uneasy feeling, not because the film was not enjoyable, but because of the way it makes us question everything. I believe there is a message that comes out of Parasite and my take on it is that: ""The act of falling is a lot worse when we fail to enjoy the summit."" So If you're looking for a film that does many things wonderfully different and will leave you with a constant thought in your mind, then maybe Parasite is what you should watch next."

People saying one of the best of the last ten years. And where I'm not sure about that, I'm sure it's a great film. You'd be hard pushed to find a genre for it. As it has a bit of everything. Really recommend giving it a watch. It's available on Prime now, there's also a black and white version that I watched but to be honest doesn't really bring much else to the film. Just felt a little pretentious. I've heard their also planning to remake this in Hollywood. So don't wait for that as we know it'll lose all the charm and subtleness of the original."

There was comedy, obvious drama and a little romance too, but it all accumulates into a thriller. It's surreal, but brilliant. Overall, Parasite is a stark commentary on the class divide within Korea, yet it doesn't paint either extreme as the lesser, the evil, or impose certain stereotypes. The difference in lifestyle and mindset is evident, yet putting these two seemingly amiable families in the same space displays the ultimate division. It's difficult film to explain to another, yet it's apparent why it won the Oscar for Best Film. Watch it, I don't see how anyone could be disappointed by it."

Did Parasite deserve it? Yes, yes it most definietly did. The direction is amazing, there is so much meaning and symbolism conveyed through simple imagery. This of course ties nicely into the script, which I think is exceptionally well written. The characters are wonderfully three-dimentional, and the contrasts between the rich family and the poor family are pretty interesting to observe and think about. This movie's greatest strength however, is the way it portrayes the differences in the lifestyle of the two families, and how the moral boundries differ from person to person. Watching the plot unfold is endlessly entertaining and engaging. The movie also manages to juggle all the symbolism with a pretty straight-forward story line, and how it manages to be powerful and funny at the same time is beyong my comprehension. The one thing I didn't completely like about this movie was the ending. Not that it was bad in itself, but the way many character arcs were scrapped annoyed me a little. I know that that was the purpose, to showcase how plans fail and all that, but I still wanted a few characters to get better conclusions to their arcs. That is practially my only real complaint though, and it's not nearly enough to ruin this fenomenal film. It is almost the complete package, it's a wonderful mix of comedy, drama and thriller, and I highly recommend it to anyone that likes movies."

One side is the cold and hard gymnasium, the other is the luxurious and soft back garden. Money is an iron. It irons everything out. They rub against the net, live in the basement, and do whatever it takes to get a job. When you think they are miserable enough, the movie suddenly reverses: they are not the worst, and worse. If you are rich, there must be richer than you; if you are poor, there must be poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls, dividing people into 369 grades. This wall, regardless of the wind, the sun and the rain, stands still. Mr. and Mrs. park look silly, but they are still getting richer and richer. The Kim family is very clever, but they can't turn over. You think that if you find a good job and get a good salary, you will get rid of the poverty status. In fact, you are still 18000 miles away. You can wash off the sweat of your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that has melted into your blood.

The reason it doesn't recieve a 10 is due to its disjointedness, which seems intentional, though I would have preferred it to be more focused and feel less rushed.

What's terrible about the director is that he has excellent directing skills and the ability to write stories. When he conceives the plot, he always thinks about how to present it to the audience."

First, the poor family is capable to completely get the trust of the wealthy family by being good servants though their motivations are dominantly evil from the beginning. A starting potential love between young members of the two families never has a true chance since it is always overruled by the evil inclinations. The thought arises that the wealthy house's architecture somehow supports the hidden presence of parasites. Now, there is a deeper level of the story: Mt 13:24-29 (The Parable of the weeds). The movie tells the story of many people in this world. It tells the story of indifference. We get good things in life and we are so indifferent and ungrateful for them, that at the end we get unworthy of them and only then do we start to learn the deeper connections of the world soul while we have to compensate for the suffering we caused with our indifference. We are never only poor sheep torn by the wolves. The wealthy family is as guilty as the poor one and a war of philosophies is launched that ends detrimental for both families."

Got it?"" 🍑 Standing head and shoulders above its awards season competition in spite of an obvious language barrier, Gisaengchung is the smartest film about class warfare for some time, and by and large the best of 2019. A brilliantly brutal masterclass in editing, pacing, writing and everything in between, acclaimed director and now household name Bong Joon-ho does for stairs in this ""pitch-black modern fairytale"" what he did for trains in 2013's Snowpiercer, and follows in Hitchcock's footsteps by taking the movie medium to a higher level. Raising his game with riveting and nail-biting sequences that rival, if not eclipse, the best of any English-language picture, Bong transfixes audiences regardless of background, race or social status, for a breath-taking and genre-bending 132 minutes that descends deep into the belly of Seoul's semi-basement dwellings in a metaphori-, no, allegorical movie miracle. Demonstrating commanding craftmanship with his scintillating, near-perfect execution, the South Korean director is not the only talent deserving of 'a glass of soju', as the oustanding ensemble cast shine brightly in this black comedy thriller, spearheaded by Bong's male muse Song Kang-ho, and dynamic camerwork from fellow countryman Hong Kyung-pyo completes the impossibly satisfying package, shooting every frame so visually rich in prescient themes that resonate with today's troubled times flawlessly. As close to cinematic poetry as achieved in the 2010s, this sardonic social satire defies genre, clichés and storytelling conventions for surprising narrative turns, gasp-inducing horror and hilarious chamber piece exchanges, all working in service of a filmgoing experience like no other released in many years. Best watched with no prior knowledge of what to expect, yet still encourages and greatly rewards repeat viewings, show this stunning feature to someone you care about, and prepare to have them left speechless by ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains""."

That is just the setting. Like many Korean film makers the audience has no clue where the film is going. That is something I really appreciate. In the end it is not realistic, but entertaining. Does the film have a deeper message? Yes, but it is for discussion. The poorer family seems quite able, but somehow unable to work. Why? Maybe because they have psycho problems (e.g. father controlling his violence). And maybe that is why many able-looking people are poor. The richer family is very nice. How often are rich people taken in like that? Well quite often I would say if the acting is right."

There are no good or bad for both the poor and the rich family. As for the performances, they are excellent taking the rhythm of the film and going from humor (often black humor) to very dramatic and intense situations, especially reaching the third act. The direction, the staging, the lighting and the staging are outstanding, as is the music, making a great choreography. This type of film was needed, making an x-ray of the most complex beings in this world and how we handle ourselves ... Humans."

Been trying my best to let friends know about how amazing some of them can be but with no luck, the language barrier and the different culture is enough to put off most from even trying. I'm glad I've sticked to it though. Old Boy was my introduction to korean movies, but Memories of Murder is what kept going back for more. Through MM I got to discover Kang Ho Song, who I personally think is an amazing actor, wont be exaggerating if I had him in my top 5, of which Al Pacino is #1. As for Parasite, dont need me to tell you that this is a gem of a movie that can't be missed, even if this is your first time venturing into korean cinema."

This film isnt a ground breaking once in a lifetime masterpiece but it is beautifully shot, acted and written. With any film, I think you must give some room to believe the unbelievable. It's a movie. It's meant to entertain, to move, to inspire, to question. People dont get what the purpose of this movie was I dont think. For me, personally, it was meant to leave us torn. In a place where no real sides were taken, so that we question it constantly, never really reaching a definitive stance. The characters are not ones to necessarily sympathize with or hate so clearly but rather there to open our eyes and really think about how incredibly ruined and beautiful this world can be, simultaneously. It was deserving of the oscar over its competition and it is deserving of your full attention, as a remarkably well crafted piece of cinema by a very talented director/writer."

I found the ending good, but a little bland given everything the story went through. Great movie, very psycho!"

Parasite revolves around one single theme: Classism. Not only is the film a stunning visuals masterpiece, but with each minute the movie sets itself up for the incoming climax, one you won't be prepared for, nearly a twist ending that we all had an inkling was coming. Parasite's clear depiction of classism between the working class and the rich is well portrayed and serves as a stellar must-watch. It's metaphors and foreshadowing will leave you questioning everything you already knew about the wealthy."

Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite, making sure to land both class' realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting, meticulous production design and breath-takingly purposeful cinematography. Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes, refreshingly, the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child. In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two. When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child, no such barrier is present, and they are on the same side. Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe. Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives, I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans."

But to be fair, I've yet to see ""The Irishman,"" ""1917,"" and ""A Hidden Life,"" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely. The originalness of ""Parasite"" is what sets it apart. ""Parasite,"" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor. Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Okja,"" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, ""The Host."" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in ""Parasite."" He's hilariously witty in both films. ""Parasite"" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so. The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city. If you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy ""Parasite."" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film. You won't see another movie like ""Parasite,"" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho."

Since Ki-woo's friend Min is going away to study he wants Ki-woo to help her. Min picks Ki-woo over his talented classmate because Min is attracted to the girl and doesn't see Ki-woo as a threat. The story is very entertaining. It was thrilling in some parts and wonderful in some. But it was brutal. This movie was a lot. It had something of everything. In my opinion, the story outweighs the acting. I didn't find the acting extraordinary. It was good actors and they did their job but they didn't make the movie. Another review I read said I loved the first 90%. I can agree. The last part is a lot. Things started happening after the first half. About halfway in the movie starts to get very interesting. And the tension rises. But the last 10 minutes I would have done without. I thought the movie left nothing. I would recommend everyone to see it because it is something different. Though I would not watch it with children. It would work with parents but I would watch it alone or with friends that don't talk during the movie."

As for the cast, I don't really know anything about any of them, as I have not seen any of the other films that they have been in, but they all did a fantastic job in their roles. The main cast does a great job at portraying this manipulative family who will do just about anything in order to make a living, while the wealthy family's actors do a great job at portraying these gullible and complacent characters that have no idea about the intentions of the workers that they have just recently hired. One thing that I absolutely loved was the entire plot and how it was executed. I did not realize how crazy this movie would end up getting, I really thought that it was just just going to be drama between two families for much of the film, but it ended up being so much more than that, I loved it.

The name implies a possible horror movie, hell, even the main poster feels horror-ish. In reality, it turns out to be a twisted dark comedy that comments on the disparities between rich and poor families, and even how the gap between them keeps widening. You're following this dirt poor family who struggles to just get by. However, there's no doubt that they all love and support each other. Miraculously, the son gets a job tutoring English for this rich family's daughter, despite not really having the qualifications. At this point, the son starts scheming up ways to get his family involved in taking advantage of this rich family, and hilarity ensues. The first half of the movie is a straight up comedy as this poor family takes advantage of the rich family, that clearly doesn't know any better. My theater was laughing up a storm, regardless of the subtitles. Reviewers, and the director, keep saying that a twist happens in the 2nd Half, which should be kept secret. However, i thought it was just par for the course, and was not surprised at all when the supposed twist happened. As you enter the 3rd Act, things start getting kinda serious and questions start being raised about who's in the right. You have a rich family that's out of touch with the world around them. On the other side, you have a poor family doing whatever it takes to survive. There's even a small discussion about how easy it is to be nice when you have tons of money. This movie has layers upon layers in what it says about the rich and the poor. Where Joker held up a mirror to society and said ""You are to blame for what happens,"" Parasite presents the good and bad between the families and kind of asks the audience, ""Who's worse?"" Yes, the rich family has it easy and seems to have it all together, but they fake almost everything about their life and are borderline disconnected from each other, and society, while even looking down on others, and not realizing it. The poor family is tight knit, but you start to wonder if they keep each other down because of how close they are. Even when the idea is presented that the brightest family member could easily transition into the rich lifestyle, the movie makes you ask if they should, as that world has a tendency to chew people up and spit them out."

The star, a stupid, low class but determine man played by Song Kang-ho. I fell in love with this movie, and then I look for another movies starred by Song Kang Ho, I get Memories of Murder, Taxi Driver and another movie about world war 2 between Korea and Japan. The I realized, most of Song Kang Ho's best movies are directed by Bong Joon-ho, which are not much. This guy is about quality, he doesn't make movie every year. It took 3 years hiatus from The Host to direct the next one, Mother, and it took another 4 years before Bong Joon-ho directed Chris Evans and Tilda Swinton. But Parasite is another masterpiece. It's easily considered as the best movie of 2019. Forget the noisy blockbuster Hollywood action flick. Parasite is a gem, a real gem that only movie lover can appreciate. Carefully directed, smooth dialog, the theme about the class struggle, the acting, the plot, the craziness, the comedic situation, all you could not easily forget. I fall in love with Korean movies because of Bong Joon-ho and Song Kang-ho."

Not because I never had wanted to, but rather because they are not exactly easy to locate. Naturally since the United States is an English speaking nation, Korean productions and other foreign language productions are not advertised as grandly as say a Quentin Tarantino film. With that being said this review is an advocation for research and stepping out of the confines of ones comfort zone. In the words of the director of this incredible film Bong Joon Ho ""Once you get over the 1- inch tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films."" So let's do as he says... let's take a leap and do something out of our comfort zone. As this film demonstrates in unequivocal terms the leap is certainly worth it!"

EXTRA! ""Class divide sweeps the globe""",2020-03-10,imdb,"In this dark comedy thriller, the Kims, a resourceful lower-class family swindle their way into employment within the home of the wealthy Park family. Rich with style and social commentary 'Parasite' presents director Bong Joon-ho in complete control of his craft. The cinematography works subtly to convey the rising tension of the film with purposeful slow push-ins on the characters. Even if the audience doesn't at first notice this subtle movement, we subconsciously feel the pressure closing in on the Kim family and a sense of foreboding disaster as their con is at risk of collapse. The film is filled with deliberate long takes, the smooth camera movement shifts the shots creating new compositions and keeps the frame visually interesting without the need to cut. This helps to give more opportunity for characters to share the screen building on the visual representation of their relationships. These long moving shots also function as a method of emphasising the scale of the Parks' house and give the audience the chance to gain a well-constructed sense of the space which is symbolic of the Parks' vast wealth. The production design is immaculate and demonstrates a careful attention to detail, both the Park and Kim houses were sets constructed for the film and while they could not be more aesthetically dissimilar, they both feel equally believable. The locations of these two houses are also important, with a not so subtle metaphor the Kim family live down a street in a semi-basement dwelling while the Park house sits atop a hill. This vertical distancing represents both the separation of the families and their respective classes. Through this visualisation we understand that there are physical structures in place enforcing the separation of the classes, while the rich keep moving up, for the poor the uphill battle only gets harder. This idea translates in the story as setbacks for the Kim family negatively compound, forcing them into a downward spiral while the Parks' with their established forward momentum easily transform obstacles into positive opportunity. But the movie is more complex than 'poor people good, rich people bad' each family possesses both good and bad traits showing a common humanity, aiming the critique towards the system rather than the people within it. The lower class can be viewed as infantilized by their idolisation of the rich, while the upper class may be considered child-like in their naivety towards the struggle of the less fortunate."

I suppose the best way for me to describe it is like a snowball going down a hill, getting bigger and bigger and then BAM! because that climax was crazy. I can definitely see why this got hyped up quite a bit, besides obviously winning the Academy Award for Best Picture. Good choice here."

I still find myself thinking about some of the dialogue, realising there were little hints in dialogue and nuanced character actions that I missed the first time round. The story of a family of impoverished con artists infiltrating the lives of a wealthy upper class family in South Korea, but with a few unexpected twists and turns along the way! The story is a clever but straight forward black comedy, however everything about it is appealing. The sets, lighting and cinematography, especially in the house of the wealthy Park family are beautiful, and the actors playing the family of con artists are just brilliant. You want them to succeed even though you know what they're doing is wrong, at at times they're just terrible people. It's an absorbing film, you're either on the edge of your seat or chuckling as events unfold. At the same time, some of the social commentary is quite jarring which gives the film some depth and gives it more impact than a straight out and out comedy. Best film out of Korea since Old Boy, loved it!"

""Parasites"" is one of the most acclaimed films at the Cannes festival and even won the golden palm, in turn was acclaimed in the ""Oscar Awards"" and won the best film, best International film and best director. Like many of his previous films, he manages to put elements of comedy and drama, comedy is well written and inserted in such a structured way that he cannot take seriousness from the other scenes that were sometimes extremely dramatic, exciting and in some terrifying parts. This film is the culmination of Bong as a total author, since he manages to link several genres in a total collision and thus generate the magic he looks for in one of his works, because ""Parasites"" is one of those works so well spun in its history and in the way in which it is said that he manages to wrap the viewer so that he cannot get rid of the screen. Like all the great movies in history, I consider the experience to be better if you don't know too much about what you are going to experience (I hate spoilers). So I will not reveal almost anything about the plot, I will only mention that several genres at the same time, a comedy, then a thriller and even a robbery movie. It is a really ambitious film and there is too much happening in matters of messages and themes, it is also incredibly well acted thanks to the depth of the characters. It is a really accessible film that can be enjoyed, because it is one of ""those films"" that you can show people who generally do not choose to watch Asian films, since it entertains you from the beginning and never gets boring, highlighting that It is taken with a beautiful cinematography, the music is fantastic with proper use, and all the characters add to the experience, making it not feel that time is wasted. Movie I would definitely see again."

I just knew: there will be a GREAT story inside - and wasn't disappointed. Light, bright images, well constructed use of space and overall clean visuality suck us deeper and deeper into the character's game. They play it bravely, they risk it all. It never gets boring during 2 hours - many unexpected plot twists, executed well with the genre methods of suspense and thriller movies. He uses his main elements well. The story ends at a completely different point (perspective?) than where we started - I had great fun watching it. I am still not sure if there's a political message or social criticism hidden behind it all - for sure it shines a light on individual fate and visible (and invisible!) differences between the rich and the poor.

Although, still couldn't surpass his previous masterpiece 'Memories of Murder', this film is without a doubt, one of the best film of 2019. As usual for Bong Joon-ho's film, this film is rather weird, which I absolutely love. The story is very original and smart. You'll find yourself questioning who's the good guy and who's the bad guy. Is it the poor who will do anything in order to survive, or is it the rich who live their life standing on top of others, ignorance of the people under them. While the film doesn't dive into the background story of the characters much, you'll still be able to grasp the motives of each characters through their expressions and subtle hints within the dialogue spoken. Moreover, every scenes shown within the film is well thought out. The contrast between the two very different social classes within the society is well hinted throughout the entire film. I'm really impressed with the efforts the filmmakers put into these small but significant moments. The casts are also excellent (and of course, that's include my favorite actors, Song Kang-ho). They all manage to seems very convincing in this weird setting. Everyone in the film all has their moments and they all have a role to play in the film. Nobody outshines the others.

Korean Cannes/ Oscar doesn't disappoint. Bong showing himself to be a cinematic master. Parasite doesn't quite take place in our universe, but nor is it a fantasy world. This is the ugliness of class conflict shown bare. The parasites are every character in this film; rich leeching off the poor, who in turn retaliate by attaching themselves to the underbelly of their rulers. Much of the story isn't told in words, but in the utilisation of space and the way people occupy it. The Kim family are often bundled into the same frame, perched awkwardly on furniture so they can all fit. Whereas the Parks always sit in separate rooms or sides of the frame. The narrative will literally take you into uncharted territory, with a fantastic conclusion. Brilliant movie."

This is the film by Korean director Joon-ho Bong, 'Gisaengchung' / 'Parasite'. It has already received 'Palme d'Or' at the Cannes festival, and this time I believe that the jury's choice is extremely appropriate. 'Parasite' is a profound and complex cinematographic work, which does not hesitate to ask painful questions about the huge differences between the social classes and the deep prejudices that divide them in today's world, but it does so in an elegant and expressive way, with images. and characters who have a chance to remain in the memory of the spectators for a long time, causing them to reflect but also engaging them with a captivating story. At the center of the story of the film are two families from today's South Korea, located at the two extremes of the society. The Parks live in a spacious and luxurious villa, full of works of art and surrounded by green landscape. He is the CEO of a large company, she is a spoiled housewife, the kids, a girl and a boy are even more spoiled. They are all surrounded by servants, drivers, tutors for children. The Kis live crammed into an unhealthy half-underground flat. The parents are unemployed, their children are smart young people, but with little chance of overcoming their social condition because of the poverty. The homes of the two families play a significant role in the story, the luxury and order of the Parks' villa hides secrets, while the claustrophobic disorder of the Kis' family home is similar to that of the family in the movie 'Shoplifters' of the Japanese director Hirokazu Koreeda. The destinies of two families accidentally intersect when the boy in the poor family becomes (with the help of forged references) the private tutor of the daughter of the rich family. As relationships intensify, cultural differences seem to diminish, the less fortunate family being equal or even superior in adapting to life and in the cultural interactions. Until about halfway through the movie, the audience is watching a social satire in a light style, a kind of 'rich family vs. poor family' story. And then everything changes. A few weeks ago, writing about another Korean film, I noticed that many of the films that came from there defy genre cataloging and combine different styles into original and surprising mosaics. 'Parasite' is yet another example in this regard."

Dong Ik gets a job as an english tutor to the daughter of a rich family, headed by father Guen Se (Myeong-hoon Park) and mother Chung Sook (Hye-jin Jang), before the rest of them weed their way in in various capacities. They get accustomed to a new quality of life, until a grievance with a disgruntled housekeeper (Rosie Peralta) who they wronged goes lethally awry. Having had a three month break from the bombardment of regurgitated Hollywood, seemingly recession proof soulless dross, that fills the cinema screens, on account of them having to close because of the pandemic, they now find themselves in a position where they're losing money regardless (like they weren't enough already.) And so, it's even more reason to give this critically acclaimed offering of world cinema from South Korea, no less, a go. While a few notches off perfect, it's still an undeniably original and inspired piece, that gives some food for thought. Director Bong Joon Ho seems to be attempting some commentary on the rich and poor divide, which undoubtedly exists in any society to some degree or another, and has his characters make some noted observations on this cold reality, with Ching Sook mentioning how rich people can afford to be nice, and become a little too trusting as a result, through to Ki Taek lamenting how having a plan is the worst thing to do, as it's the surest way for things to go wrong. Are these people in the state they're in because they're lazy and unethical, or does the system work to keep them grinded down? It's maybe a little overlong, and the ending does drag on a bit, but it undoubtedly leaves an impression, and makes you wonder what other hidden treasures the Koreans are hiding from us? ****"

Only the third film to win both the Palme d'Or and the Academy Award for Best Picture, Parasite is one of the best-reviewed films of the century thus far and caused huge waves when it became the first non-English language film to win Best Picture. Co-writer and director Bong Joon Ho also tied with Walt Disney for the most Oscars awarded to one person in one night - four. On top of that, he became the first person in history to win more than three Oscars for a single film. In short, Parasite has had a significant, and relatively unexpected, impact. But what exactly is Parasite? Described on its official website as a ""pitch-black modern fairy-tale"", even a comprehensive plot summary wouldn't adequately delineate its real nature - part comedy of manners, part social satire, part heist film, part thriller, part horror, part family drama, part farce, part economic treatise, part social realism, part tragedy, part allegory. And that's just the opening scene! It's the Ulysses of cinema, adopting and shedding genres so often and so seamlessly that it effectively becomes its own genre. And, like Ulysses, it's exceptional in just about every way - screenplay (co-written by Bong and ), directing, cinematography, mise en scène, editing, production design, sound design, score, acting. There's not a weak link here, in a film that achieves that rarest of things - it lives up to the hype. The Kim family are down on their luck. Father Ki-taek (), mother Chung-sook (), daughter Ki-jeong (), and son Ki-woo () reside in a tiny basement apartment, with their only window looking out onto a popular urination spot in a back alley. With all four unemployed, they eke out a meagre living folding pizza boxes for a nearby restaurant. However, their fortunes change when Ki-Woo meets Min-hyuk (), a childhood friend who is now at university. Min-hyuk works as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family, but he's soon to leave Korea, and so suggests that Ki-Woo take over. Armed with a fake diploma created by Ki-jeong on Photoshop, Ki-Woo successfully applies for the job. The Park family, father Dong-ik, (), mother Yeon-gyo (), daughter Da-hye (), and son Da-song (), welcomes Ki-woo into their lavish home, and upon discovering just how wealthy the Parks are, the Kims hatch an elaborate scheme to oust the Park's current domestic staff and take their places."

There certainly was deeper meanings to the film and great exposure to the Korean culture. The problem with this film isn't the film at all but those reviewing it. For those that swoon about the film or those that call it awful are way off base. The film is neither; and it certainly isn't a Tarantino violent style film. It is a good film I'd probably see a couple more times to find all the different angles of this complex story. It won best picture for good reason but it certainly didn't bury the competition; any of those could have won depending on what the viewer was looking for.

But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey. On their fierce face I don't see any extra thoughts. No concerns about ethnicity, pain or morality. But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner. There isn't any flamboyance in that.

I was very excited to see this movie with my wife, who, uncharacteristically, was interested in a foreign art film. There's a lot going on in this movie so I am afraid my own exploration of it here, will only scratch the surface of what there is to say about it. I'll only briefly mention the cinematography which is just wonderful. This is Joon-ho unleashed from the bonds of entertainment that are part and parcel with a film that is released on Netflix (Okja) or in American theaters (Snowpiercer.) Here, he can luxuriate with height imagery ranging from subterranean staircases to winding city streets descending into the slums in order to sub-textually communicate ideas to his audience and he does it with subtle panache'. What I think the average movie goer will appreciate most about this film is the dichotomy of humor and terror in the characters, acting, script, and general 'feel' of the film. It is certainly the most jarring turn of atmosphere I have seen in a film this year and one that I like to imagine every one who watches this film will enjoy and experience as a true revelation. The themes of class struggle and survival all writ large in this film. From the beginning where we see the poor as they seek to find the means to sustain their lives by abandoning their true identities to be whatever the rich want them to be in order to glean scraps from their table to the dismissal of the poor for even the hint of an offense rather than actually getting to know them and their place to the desperation of people being asked to sub-exist and their eventual reaction, this film stuns by not only displaying the benefits of a life linked to a wealthy person and the happiness that some find there but also watching that happiness turn to despair as time passes. The humor and joy that is in ""Parasite"" is truly experienced by the audience so that the turn feels true as well when the rug is pulled out. This isn't a horror movie with a dash of humor, or a funny movie with a sprinkle of violent class struggle. It is both, one of the funniest movies I've seen all year and the terror inducing in the same way as the best atmospheric horror that $11.50 at your local cinema can buy. All of this is interesting but, if done too heavy-handed, feels preachy or propagandist."

Utterly original. At times darkly funny. Plus a biting social commentary. But at times also uncomfortable viewing. Verging on horror, which I am not keen on. No individual character you can root for. Clearly, for most the positives far outweigh the negatives. It is easy to see why it garnered so many awards. And to understand why so many viewers are so taken with the film. But for me the negatives are real enough. Perhaps the biggest problem is that I cannot be on the side of any individual character, so I watched as a somewhat disinterested spectator. That lack of emotional investment also meant that I was unable to shrug off the other negatives. Yet I cannot mark down too far a film that is so utterly original. That alone makes this worth your time."

Whoever saw Bong Joon Ho's ""Parasite"" will definitely agree with the director's populist political stance. Now only if someone would've told him that as well. Without spoiling, I can tell you that ""Parasite"" is definitely satisfying. This is a thriller calculated to the nano-meter, equal in precision, pressure, unease and focus. It revolves around Ki-taek and his family--poor, unemployed and living in a ""semi-basement""; some sort of small place halfway underground. Forcing the metaphor, I could argue that is placed symbolically to represent the clear-cut line between the lower and upper classes. They are poor, which forces them to be clever and witty in order to survive. So their plan is to ""attach"" themselves to a rich family. For the sake of not spoiling, I will stop here. But know that ""Parasite"" touches on every single social point it tries to make. It is a well-defined story of class and the lack of social awareness. This works in the first half of the film, in which the naivete of the rich and the wit of the poor is augmented. This is not done to oversimplify but for the movie to properly present its parable which, by definition, is a ""simple story"". But if this heavy-handed approach pays off, by the end it pushes the characters into unnecessary, inexplicable, sometimes seemingly random explosions of rage. ""Parasite"" is undeniably cutting-edge and modern. Bong Joon Ho uses traditional fables to conceptualize and clarify the vagaries of modernity. Throughout its complexion, it looks decidedly simple as its frames wonder around the minimalist and polished performant Asian architecture of the privileged property where most of the movie takes place--a movie as harsh with its characters as it is with its viewers."

On the surface, we know what's it about: the story about two families from extreme ends of the social ladder. The Parks with their high-tech mansion and luscious front yard that hides them from the outside world and the Kims with their sub-basement apartment and a window that allows them to look at their sad reality just enough to keep fighting and surviving. What is not obvious though is the why. What transpired in the movie is believable, but the why is what makes the difference. Maybe it's a cultural thing, where here in the Philippines as depicted in soap operas a million times over the Have-Nots are automatically nice people, hopeful that things will get better as long as they keep working hard. Meanwhile the Haves are depicted as calculating and manipulative, taking advantage of those that they can. In Parasite, it's the other way around. And this is very evident when the head of the Kim household commented that the Parks are rich but still nice. To which his wife countered, they are nice because they are rich. That money makes living easy therefore they are not as stressed, that's why they can afford and have the time to be nice. Which is true. I related to when she said that if she had what they had, she'd be kinder too. Of course it's not automatic though and there are always the exception to the rule. Everyone were well-casted most especially Choi Woo-Shik (Fight for My Way) as the young Kim with whom the chain of events started. I mean I know I'm supposed to hate him but the combination of his cunning and naivete makes him appealing to me and even to the Parks. Cho Yeo-jeong as Mrs. Park was also a standout, playing a balance of a simple yet hands-on head of the household. You may also notice Lee Sun-kyun (The Coffee Prince) as Mr. Park and Park Seo-joon (Fight for My Way/ Secretary Kim) in a supporting role. The last character of note is the the Parks' house itself. It has a personality of it's own, commanding your attention whenever you're within it's premises. Winning the 2019 Cannes Palm D'or award and besting 20 other foreign films, submitted to be South Korea's entry for Best Foreign film at the Oscars, a 99% Rotten Tomato rating and 8.5 in IMDB, you can not go wrong with this movie. It was well-written, the ""infiltration"" of the host by the parasites flowed naturally."

Is it the best of the year? I do not think so, but I do think it is an excellent foreign film with a clear criticism about class conflicts but I like it much more as the movie shoplifters puts it, being more realistic and cruel to the point of making you reflect and depress you for its plot. sorry for my English."

After the son has the good fortune of getting a well-paying job in the home of a wealthy family, his other family members manipulate their way into similar good fortune. Massive chaos follows. Among universally acclaimed films, ""Parasite"" is unique: it is actually worthy of its acclaim. It could be described as bizarrely amazing or amazingly bizarre. Maybe both. The first half succeeds as a farcical comedy before going dramatic with many plot twists and turns, suspense, thrills, and a class war to top it off. The film also wins with its flexibility and mystery as to who are the potential villains. And it has a climax that must be among the best of all time. While most of the dramatic surprises are welcome, some seem unnecessary and over the top (non-spoiler hint: the scene with the aftermath of a huge rainfall); there are also a few false endings. But these pale compared to the film's many assets the best of which is its uniqueness and originality. The cast is great too especially Song Kang-ho as the patriarch of the poor family. His face registers so much pent-up emotion. And director Bong Joon-ho has talents that are comparable to those of Alfred Hitchcock. It is easy to compare ""Parasite"" with last year's ""Burning"", another South Korean film that digs deeply into modern class conflicts in explosive ways. While these are only two examples, it seems South Korean cinema leads the way in acknowledging contemporary class struggles - a problem that has exacerbated everywhere for the past three decades or so. Hopefully, these fine examples will inspire many more film-makers in all countries."

As for my take on it, two scenes stayed with me long after the movie ended : One is the Kim family relaxing in their employers - the Parks- mansion after they go on a picnic. The Parks are unaware that the driver, housekeeper, tutor and translator they hired are all one family - the Kims having cunningly manipulated them to seek employment. Talking about the scene, Father Kim remarks that their madam is a nice lady. Rich yet Nice. To which his wife corrects him saying She's nice because she's rich. In yet another amazingly conceived scene, the Park couple is now lying - incidentally on the same drawing room sofa - and Mr Park observes how driver Kim is a well behaved guy who doesn't cross his limit yet he hates his stink. He smells like an old rag!! In those two scenes, writer director Bong Joon-Ho makes a solid statement on class divide which may not be seemingly apparent but exists and thrives universally at mind set level. Parasite is a highly relatable drama - blending comedy in to serious situations - culminating in to a cracker of a bloodied climax. Infact, it won't be an exaggeration to say that it explores myriad human relationships like no other film and leaves you wondering at the end who exactly is the parasite here!! Watch it online on Amazon Prime. The film has English subtitles. Regards Sumeet Nadkarni"

The son gets an opening with the wealthy Kim family, working as an English tutor. Piece by piece, the other members of the Kim clan scheme their way in such that all four of the Kim family - father as driver, mother as housekeeper, son as tutor, daughter as art teacher/therapist - end up working for the Parks, though the Parks don't know of the relationship between them. Part (often hilarious) black comedy, part love story, part thriller, all class commentary, Parasite really is a genre-defying film. And, it's genuinely enjoyable. The film highlights the class divisions between the Kim family and the Park family, particularly in the incredible contrasting storm scenes - the Kims have their house upended; the Parks host a backyard camping adventure. What made the film work so well, in my opinion, is that most members of the Kim family do not act as ""good"" people. They lie to get their jobs, they steal from the Park family, and they're willing to frame and undermine the existing help in order to get them fired, even though those people are of the same struggling social class as the Kims. There's no class solidarity here, just doing whatever it takes to get ahead. I stop at 8/10 though, because I can't get beyond the feeling that the whole basement setup was a contrived device to move along the film and/or unsubtle metaphor. There's a secret underground shelter beneath the house (that the Parks don't know about) and where the housekeeper has been storing her husband for half a decade? The owners never get wind of this, perhaps because they're oblivious to the help who are - quite literally - beneath them. The people living in the bowels of the house feed off the inhabitants up top, like a parasite. And we know that a parasite that goes untreated just might kill its host. Get it? It's a great film, definitely worth watching. But watching it after hearing all the hype, Parasite just didn't hit me as a 10/10."

They soon find themselves in the middle of a dark, unexpected secret. REVIEW: This film is truly an original masterpiece. From Bong Joon Ho's direction to all of the phenomenal acting. So intricate and precise it left a really special film. POSITIVES: As I mentioned, the directing is absolutely superb. Bong Joon Ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film. You feel as though your living through what the characters are living through. The acting is Oscar worthy all around. Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together. The big stand outs to me were definitely Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong. I feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was the build up for Kim Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of Park Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). You really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance. NEGATIVES: Its tough for me to come up with any negatives. This is one of those films where I don't see very much wrong at all, however, it's a film I couldn't see myself rewatching more than twice. Not that it's a bad film or too heavy subject matter, it's just not one of those films I gravitate towards for multiple viewings and that's why I don't have it as a perfect 10/10. CONCLUSION: This is one of those films I definitely encourage everyone to see at least once. It's so original and so well told that I know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema. It will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film. Superb all around from cinematography to editing. This is a great film to get those opposed to foreign films on the boat. 8.9/10."

Highly entertaining film that mixes genre styles or tropes giving a wholesome movie watching experience. The agony of poverty and class inferiority is the raging theme of Parasite. At first, knowing the title of the film and the directors previous films i thought this was going to be a ""Apocalyptic virus outbreak"" kind of film, But it turns out a metaphor for the plot of the story - A poor family finds a rich family and slowly becomes a part of their house and their life and in the end the parasite does what a parasite does."

I have seen the other academy award nominees, and although this movie was excellent - I think that Once Upon a Time was better. Joker and Irishman are both more a series of scenes around one actor - but Parasite is a movie where there is no single dominant actor as such. The lead role is Kim the father, but in many contexts it is also about the son, daughter and mother - the parasites."

It's accurate enough to the storyline but as an English word it's a bit creepy in tone. I think it needed a somewhat different translation from the original Korean. But on to the film itself: obviously it's a labor of love for Bong Joon Ho, who's the writer, director, and producer. I didn't know any of the actors beforehand but they are all just fine, and they do a great job at making each one have distinct personalities among a fairly big cast of speaking roles. I also like that in our theater we got subtitles rather than some clumsy dubbing. (and the subtitles are the best and most accurate I've seen in recent times.) For lack of a better term I would describe this as a tragicomedy. A slum-dwelling family of four in an unnamed Korean city live by their wits on odd jobs. Through a series clever little twists they find a way to gradually insinuate themselves into jobs as servants to a young rich suburbanite family who never suspect what they're getting. (The young family are indeed rich enough to pay a whole coterie of servants including a driver, tutor, housekeeper, and nanny, but they're not uber-rich like the Crazy Rich Asians -- they actually do work hard and have their own issues. Not knowing any better, I'll take it for granted that their ultra-modern Western-style home and garden are realistic depictions of that class.) For about the first half of the movie this plotline is played for a good deal of humor. But then through another series of twists this house of cards comes down and things go sideways , leading to a rather shocking final scene. Quite a lot hinges on the maybe-improbable presence of a hidden underground bunker and a key character introduced very late in the story (no spoilers). There turns out to be more than one ""parasite"" at work, and it's more than just the young rich folks who don't know what they are getting into. It's a complex, multilayered story (2:12 run time) and the director throws quite a lot at us. But there are no wasted or unnecessary scenes. A prominent example is during a freak torrential rainstorm. The rich folks (on the high ground, as we notice for the first time) just sit inside their beautiful garden, while the poor slum dwellers cannot save their pathetic basement flat from being washed away (complete with raw sewage in the streets). It's excruciating to watch, and this is where the message hits home."

This is a highly entertaining film that starts off as a comedy/drama and gets darker as it goes along, becoming a rather sinister mystery thriller with some highly effective horror elements. Most films that try to cover multiple themes end up messy but 'Parasite' never felt in danger of that. At a time when the film industry seems to be increasingly short of original ideas, something as fresh as 'Parasite' is always welcome. The comedy genre in particular just seems to be made up of the same recycled jokes - this film is funny while being completely different to anything else out there at the moment and that alone is quite an achievement. 'Parasite' is great, highly recommended for those growing tired of the usual stale Hollywood productions."

South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho already has an impeccable track record, but he's stepped up his game with this brilliant, powerfully revealing social satire. The film had its world premiere at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival on 21 May. It was released in South Korea on 30 May 2019. Described by its creator as ""a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains"", Parasite is more Shakespearean than Hitchockian - a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong's back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond. We first meet the Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), in their lowly semi-basement home, hunting for stray wifi coverage and leaving their windows open to benefit from bug-killing street fumigation. They have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. So when son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family. An architectural wonder perched high above the slums of Seoul, with views not of urinating drunks but of luxurious lawns and starlit skies, this wealthy house is everything the Kims' pokey dwelling is not: elegant, angular and weirdly isolated. While aloof businessman Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is at work, his anxious, uptight wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. It's a lifestyle that relies upon hired help: tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun), who stayed with the building after its original architect owner moved out. Spying an opening, Ki-woo (newly dubbed ""Kevin"") realises that his own family could easily fill such roles, and hatches a plan that will inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks. He Kim family may live in sewage-flooded squalor, but they are clearly every bit as smart as, and a lot more united than, the Parks, who turn their noses up at the smell of ""people who ride the subway""."

I believe all the actors here are very talented theater players, because the words, expressions, and how they interpret the story are so natural, then also will make you laugh in some serious scenes. The title ""Parasite"" will be understandable if you also concentrate on what the core idea of the Director wants to deliver, about being a family, a partner in crime, group of friends, etc. Even people clap their hands at the ending of the scene. Now my curiosity have been pay off and still I am wondering this movie could be new standard of Asian irony-comedy.

The traditional view is that literary films are films that are more reflective of profound thoughts, but they also mean a good and tangible experience. Commercial films are just the opposite. Nowadays, the Korean film industry has already had a work that combines depth and perception. At this time, Chinese movies are still drifting away in the mud of money. 2.The appearance of breakthrough represents more mature thinking The film depicts mainly class differences and divisions. But the most core breakthrough is the opposite of good and evil. In the traditional film of the reaction to the class, the rich are always portrayed as rich and poor, and the poor are always diligent and kind. The film is the opposite. The rich man is a hard-working woman who has a family and his children are not awkward; the poor are savage and sneaky. The reconciliation of this character image shows that the film's creative thinking is more mature, and it is no longer necessary to deliberately highlight the theme through class opposition. And through more realistic role positioning, with the plot, to communicate with the audience. 3.Understatement and into the wood This film is used to distinguish the class, the most important thing is the smell. You don't need a luxury shoe bag, you don't need to travel Shopping, just such a label that has been neglected and yet vivid, has become a finishing touch. What is the smell of living in a dark and damp basement for a long time? The film gives a more appropriate description, ""cooking the taste of the rag"". This distinction does not help the audience not applaud. The whole film did not deliberately render the hardships and hardships of the poor. It's just the smell, with the long ladder in the rainstorm, the sewage filled in the basement, it seems to be understated but it is three times. As a negative example, you can compare the ""Taste of Money"" (2012), I believe that everyone will be able to feel the shackles of spilling the screen, how boring. 4.Calm, is the biggest gap After completing the division of the two classes by smell, how to show the gap between the two classes? The director gave a unique answer: calm. When the male master stood at the window and looked at the hilarious party on the grass outside the window, he could not help but tell the difference between the two classes: calmly."

Well the first thing which comes to mind is that Parasite is a fantastic movie in almost every aspect, I said almost in the description as well and that is simply because there is a small number of details that someone who has kids can find a little out of hand, without crashing you the film I'd say that not even this kind of parents would allow the kids drinking like crazy, particularly if I'm not mistaken in a kind of family culture like they have in this country. That said, the story is extremely intelligent and well written brutally funny at times quite violent and direct too and when this things happen, they do for a reason and perfectly integrated in the story. Cinematography is excellent, Direction and casting fantastic and the cast performances are top notch, the two starring families describing perfectly their ways of life and how the interaction between them and the social aspects of that are paramount in how the story develops until the very end. As I said, a film that will leave you speechless many times and will make you have a sensational time.

Maybe it is easier to determine who or what is or are the hosts? The first hour plays as though Adam Sandler had directed a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, a tale about the poor serving, or parasitically suckling upon, the rich, separated vertically so those on high do not, or even cannot, observe the filth of the lower classes as they struggle to acquire the most basic necessities, such as a good and free wi-fi signal. The second hour plays as though Sam Peckinpah had directed a Korean version of Upstairs, Downstairs, a tale about desperate times and desperate measures, uncertainty about belonging, and a lesson about the fleetingness of a good situation. The mood of Parasite runs somewhat tangentially to that of A Serious Man, a slightly anarcho-nihilistic tone that despite anyone's good or bad intentions, or even lack of intent entirely, there is a dark hole tugging at the back of our brains whispering sweet somethings of impending, unavoidable, and utterly passionless doom. Given this background, one might argue that there is no message, no meaning to a movie like Parasite. At the least, it is an investigation into whether a host or parasite can change its behavior for the better or for the worse."

Even allowing for poor translation, a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow, several plot threads are introduced that don't go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained, and too many elements (the morse code, for instance) stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell, rather than making any sense *within* that story. But for all that, Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema: a twisted, amoral, mischevious inventiveness, interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out-of-nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration (in this instance, at a kick down some stairs). I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all, and it's a doozy, taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I'd been expecting. Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying, Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look."

It was brilliant. Reminds me of another brilliant movie I just saw JoJo Rabbit.

I'm taken away by what a good story about social status is was. Recommend highly

The film is a remarkable experience that makes modern movie-going such a joy, and the author saw it for the fourth time last week and is now eager to view the black-and-white version that Bong recently unveiled at the Rotterdam film festival. Parasite is a tale of two families from opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, told with the trademark genre-fluidity that has seen Bong's back catalogue slip seamlessly from murder mystery, via monster movie, to dystopian future-fantasy and beyond. The Kim family, headed by father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and mother Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), have nothing but one another and a shared sense of hard-scrabble entrepreneurism. When son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) is faced with an unexpected opportunity to home-tutor a rich schoolgirl, he gets his gifted artist sister, Ki-jung (Park So-dam), to forge a college certificate, bluffing his way into the job and into the home of the Park family. Ki-woo (newly dubbed ""Kevin"") is a wealthy businessman who lives in a luxurious house above the slums of Seoul. His wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. Mr Park (Lee Sun-kyun) is at work, while his wife, Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong), tends to their coquettish daughter and hyperactive young son. Mr Park relies on hired help such as tutors, a chauffeur and, most importantly, a devoted housekeeper Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun). Ki-woo discovers that his own family could easily fill these roles and hatches a plan to inveigle the Kims into the privileged lives and home of the Parks. Parasite is a melancholy ghost story disguised by generic mutations. It is a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul. It is played by a flawless ensemble cast who hit every note and harmonic resonance of Bong and Han Jin-won's multitonal script."

No worries, you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike Mother! & Us. Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation. With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film. Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours. Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining. Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements. The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall. Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart. In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror."

I can definitely see Bong's signature style that we can also see in Snowpiercer, especially the social satire. Both of the families in this film have their own issues that really come out. The main point is the overall setting, portrayed visually through the architecture. Everyone is trapped by the class system and cannot escape except by ruthlessly attacking each other for what amounts to not much in the end."

For a foreign film from Korea, this is very accessible for all languages and audiences. The actors are all expressive, attractive, and do a really good job acting. The story has lots of universal, contemporary components to it of pop culture. For what it's worth, the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea's ""City of God"", or something along those lines; what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed, well-written, and pretty gritty. It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy, which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller, part mystery (without giving away spoilers). I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating, but unfortunately I just could not. Sorry, but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded, and that's not to say that it wasn't fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work, but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the ""perfect"" range of storytelling. The same issue also arose in the second, back half of the movie- some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10. However, other than these two (fairly big- big enough to deduct two points) flaws, the script is practically perfect, especially for a foreign film. The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate, immerse, and challenge your mind, while also keeping it entertaining. They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made. I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility. It could still happen, but after viewing it with an open mind, it looks like it's between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917. EDIT: Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat."

I would like to add the names of people with mentioned country and neighborhood are quite confusing and it takes effort which is escalated even more if you are to understand it with subtitles. A day came when I decided to again give it a try. The reason being Oscars this time. The movie won four Oscars. After searching for hindi version I settled for youtube narration for one fifth of time. What did I conclude was is everything associated was good enough but then still it was overrated. Once again my belief of awards being overrated stood concrete. Final Verdict: The story is not something good on the senses neither in the category all's well that ends well.

The balance he strikes between the grave sincerity of his subject matter and the agile levity and stimulating smarts of his filmmaking gifts regularly reveals a deeply spiritual artist, one who wants audiences to pay attention, but who also knows that getting audiences to transform often requires age-old stories to be told in freshly affecting ways. Parasite burrows far deeper than most films dealing with economic disparity. Its sheer weirdness and wit undergird a profound meditation on the rancid decay at the core of a society that turns up its nose at the stench of truth. It invites exploration of what lies beneath the politely accepted status quos of wealth and poverty with the force of an inevitable revolution. Like the striving family at its center, Parasite is not to be underestimated and will never be forgotten."

This Korean masterclass assumes no clear genre, refusing to pigeonhole its ambition. Straddling the line between comedy, thriller, and horror, the production presents the conceptual 'parasite' as the underlying motif; it's a profound, tragic social commentary on classism as much as it is a satirical, sardonic throwaway remark on a parasite and its host. Decorated with multidimensional metaphors, signs and symbols, it would be criminal to not have a second or even third viewing to fully soak up Bong Joo-ho's flavoursome visual poetry. Should you laugh or cry? Take sides, or simply observe the events unfold? In taking no clear stance does this movie most thrive. In stirring and string-pulling every capacity of human emotion while dodging the clichés does it tantalise the audience like few other productions have. While slow in places, and with an occasional plothole, this was overall a gorgeously shot, satisfyingly unpredictable slice of thoughtful motion picture entertainment; presenting a particularly dark blend of black comedy. 8.4/10"

As the movie opens, we get to know the family: they live in a semi-basement apartment, and mom and dad are out of work, and their teenage son and daughter aren't in much better shape. Then one day, the son's friend Min informs him that he is leaving the country, and that it would be good if the son takes over for him as the private English tutor of a HS sophomore girl, whose family is well-off, if not rich. The son agrees, and before we know it he is now the English tutor... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out. Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Korean writer-director Bong Joon-ho, best known for his 2013 ""Snowpiercer"" film. Here he brings a one-of-a-kind story that is so plot-heavy that I cannot take any risks in spoiling anything, so my comments will be brief. Let me say this: there is a good reason that ""Parasite"" won the top prize (Palme d'or) at this year's Cannes film festival, and I will already go on record that there is zero chance that this movie isn't getting an Oscar nomination early next year for Best Foreign Language movie. The movie is everything that Hollywood at its worst (with endless sequels, prequels, franchises and ""re-imaginations"") isn't: It's original, it's witty, and it's storytelling at its very best. ""Parasite"" got a limited release in New York and LA in early October, and has gradually been rolling out to more cities. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. Man, I couldn't wait to see this! The Friday late afternoon screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great (10 people), but I am quite certain that as word of mouth gets around, this will find its box office legs in the weeks to come. If you are in the mood for a top=notch foreign movie that is original and witty and will have you on the edge of your seat, I'd readily suggest you run, don't walk, to check this out, be it at the theater, on Amazon Instant Video, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."

Every news story from South Korea carried by our Western Media shows glittering highrises , gleaming, if crowded, cities and fabulous transportation systems. Everyone is slim and good looking, everyone has a great job in the electronics industry and it's capitalism at its best, or so they would have us believe. Underneath this glamour is the same societal structure as there is in the West.... fabulously rich people and the wretched poor. The story, and we've seen it many times before, is that the wretched poor want to even things up by stealing from, or conning, the rich. It's just human nature at work. If only the socialists studied that same human nature, instead of being angry at the rich, they would be able to come up with workable solutions to the injustice, but I digress, let's move back to the job at hand. With the backdrop of South Korea as our tableau we get into a pretty good plot with the underclass pulling a scam on a rich but naive family. The scammer protagonists, Mother, Father, Sister, Brother, are living in squalor in a slum, with no real hope of getting out, when they have a stroke of luck by scoring an introduction to a wealthy family. They use their devious talents to infiltrate the family and before you know it they have all been hired by them to look after their domestic needs, with well paid, luxury jobs. From there on in we have the wonderful juxtaposition of the wealthy family living a Kardashian type lifestyle (only much more refined) against the ""we've hit the jackpot"" mentality of the slum dwellers. Of course there's no ""off"" switch for scammers and the beauty of this film is the way they manage the story as it spirals out of control.......... it is really well done. The acting is superb and the mise en scène is just fabulous. The pacing is right on the button and it's no wonder the film attracted so much attention. Even with the subtitles it is a very absorbing movie and although I wouldn't put it in the ""classic"" category (as I would with ""A Separation"") it's one I could easily watch again and enjoy it just as much. I have no doubt that it must have been the best picture from the choices that the Academy had. It's head and shoulders above ""The Irishman"" and head and shoulders above any other Hollywood movie I watched this past year. Well worth watching!"

I first seen it back in November at an advanced screening. I think anyone watching this after the Oscars will probably think it is over rated (I certainly think that about Gladiator and Silence Of The Lambs) and 1917 should have won. I'm not one of them, I loved 1917, but I loved this equally as much, and I was totally fine with it winning. If movies with subtitles bother you, this will not be for you. For me thought, it is 100% original, you'll never know where it is going, the acting is great by all concerned and it is darkly funny. I have to say, It was a lot more effective on its first watch, as I knew nothing about the movie (which is how I think it should be seen) and it simply blew me away. That has now been taken away now, but it is still a great movie."

I wouldn't have had a problem with the movie if the tone had kept consistent, if I wasn't being set up for a Rian Johnson style ""subvert your expectations"". Also the portrayal of class differences is taken to ridiculous levels here, it's just not realistic. ""Oh look, feel bad about these people because the rich people literally wrinkle their noses at how they smell"".

The film focuses on the Kims, who live in a small basement apartment and are desperate for a better life. When they're not studying or doing the odd poorly paid and thankless job like packing pizza boxes, they try to cut corners by attempting to use their neighbors' wifi or getting rid of cockroaches by letting in anti-pest fumes through their window when the pest control guy patrols the alleyway above, where drunks often go to throw up. Through a contact, Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik), the son, is given the temporary opportunity to take over tutoring the daughter of the well-off Park family. This opens the Kims up to using this idea of trusted contacts in order to infiltrate the Park household by each doing a different job for them. They pretend to be virtual strangers, sabotage the people already working for the Parks and everything goes according to plan... until it doesn't. Much has been said about the themes explored in Parasite and, indeed, you don't see this poor/rich dynamic done in such a bold way very often. Recent release Knives Out attempted something along the same lines but Parasite never sugarcoats the Kims, which could have come off as condescending and often does whenever, incidentally, an Oscar-nominated film tries to reach out to minorities or people below the middle class. Green Book, for example, probably had its heart in the right place but its dated execution left many cold. The Kims may be the victims of a society that turns everyone into parasites but so are the Parks: Bong Joon-ho wisely avoids the ""poor people are inherently good"" and ""rich people are inherently bad"" dichotomy, instead taking aim at the system as a whole to show how it dehumanizes people in different ways, breeding resentment, desperation, even violence between them. Of course, there is a power imbalance here as well with the Parks having all of it throughout, by virtue of their wealth, despite the Kims' best attempts at leveling things somewhat so the Kims were doomed from the start. This dynamic, along with a shocking twist halfway through, leads to some nail-biting conflicts within the Parks' swanky house and it reaches a boiling point by the end."

Both SHOPLIFTERS and PARASITE hinge around the underclass, but a more apposite reference of the latter should be Lee Chang-dong's BURNING (2018), a Cannes also-ran, both Lee and Bong vigorously tackle the ubiquitous classism, the pathological canker in our modern society, while Lee deliberately and stylishly veils his central story with elusiveness and makes great play of the ambivalent mystique exuded from the unattainable pursuance of truth, here, Bong cunningly employs gripping genre tropes to underpin his trenchant perspicacity on the treacherous waters of rich and poor's co-existence. In Seoul, the semi-basement dwelling Kim family - patriarch Ki-taek (Song), his wife Chung-sook (Jang), their two adolescent children, son Ki-woo (Choi) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam), slyly insinuates their way into being employed by the high-flying Park family, respectively, as their driver, housekeeper, English tutor and art teacher.

I won't go into too much detail about the movie as I don't want to spoil anything.

The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too. I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high. The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."

If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year. It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story, to see the father of the family on the same scene , trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is fine. So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families. Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them? Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that makes us react the way we do."

They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood. When I see a decent foreign film I can't help but want to praise it more because they don't have the multi-billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them. Usually, they have to be more creative, more ingenious, and more resourceful. ""Parasite"" is one of very few Korean films I've watched in my life. My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung-fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space. Korean films are a rarity for me. This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon-Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received. What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them. That is essentially what happened, but you're not holding anyone's attention with that concept alone. Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable. As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family, we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script. How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either? Some how ""Parasite"" did that. The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded, but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead. The Park family was wealthy, yet unlike your average rich movie family, they were not cruel or unbearable people. In fact they were very likeable. Normally, we want our clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose. In the cases where all of our guys are good, we want them all to win. In the cases where all our guys are bad, we want them all to lose. In ""Parasite"" not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners."

And I made no mistake. Parasite is a quite particular and diverse work, which is responsible for building a story original and charismatic, attractive and yet slightly disturbing, but in a way that leaves us a strong emotion at the end of seeing it. With a fairly solid and interesting start, the film takes a complete turn in half and becomes even more entertaining and fascinating than it seems at first, showing a quality good enough to attract my attention, the unexpected. However, it's not just the interesting plot, but the provocative narrative and beautiful cinematography that builds the characters in a deep and realistic way. Creating palpable characters full of mistakes and at the same time humanity. Finishing with a strong and emotional escapeist ending, a unique film that is sweetly welcomed into the small collection of original and fantastic 21st century films.

But everything changes when they get entangled in an unexpected incident which they couldn't even think of it. I enjoyed this movie because it was very unexpected and full of surprises.

Regarding the interpretations, Kang-ho Song who played as Kim Ki-taek was simply outstanding, Yeo-jeong Jo who played as Park Yeon-kyo was equally good and Woo-sik Choi who played as Kim Ki-woo made a very good interpretation. The direction which was made by Bong Joon Ho is simply amazing and in addition to a very interesting script makes this movie not only interesting but something very different and unique.

We start with a family living in a slum basement apartment who, through a tutoring opportunity given to the son, successively infiltrate the home of a wealthy family in the capacity of personal servants. They manage to do this through deception and subterfuge against the family's current help staff. It's easy to see the parasitical nature of this impoverished family yet the wealthy family isn't able to perform normal daily tasks without the help of others implying that they're parasites of the lower classes since their lives would fall apart without them. The story unfolds in a very unique way starting as something of a comedy and becoming progressively darker with several key plot twists that were an enjoyable surprise. There were serious logical flaws with the ending of the film; it wasn't a believable ending but the overall story was very engaging and interesting. There was a very distinct visual style to the film, partly created out of necessity of the story. The use of levels of buildings and staircases helps create a visually engaging film and aids in the telling of the story in important ways. You also have a sharp contrast in visual spaces between the impoverished family and wealthy family's apartments with both the spatial dimension and the windows. The basement apartment is cramped with low a ceiling and dirty window people urinate in front of while the wealthy home was custom designed by a famous architect, has wide open spaces and a large wall window looking out at well lit private yard. What stood out most about this film was the initial set up creating an expectation of a moralistic tale about class struggle that gets shattered fairly quickly and by the end is completely non-existent. There was no moral lesson being preached and instead we're given a raw look at human nature."

However, it was a good movie. Everyone acted really well and the underlying social commentary that is so common in Boon Joon Ho's movies was very strong while telling the story of a family of poor people who scam their way into the employ of a rich family and start leeching of it. The divide between the rich and arrogant upper class and the very poor is made obvious by this dark movie with occasional comedic undertones. Bottom line: movies about poor people scheming to get money fast are too common in Romanian cinematography. Probably that is why this movie didn't really impress me too much. It is a good movie and very well made, but the story was just... meh."

On one hand, we have Kim Ki-taek (the brilliant Song Kang-ho), an out-of-work driver who lives in a dingy apartment with his wife Choong Sook (a mighty effective Jang Hye-jin) and his two college-age kids Ki-woo and Ki-jyeong. On the other, we have the well-off family of Mr Park that comprises of himself, his wife Yeon-Kyo, and his two children Da-Hye and Da-song. A series of events leads to Kim ki-woo getting employed by the Park family as Da-Hye's tutor. Then, we come across the master-plan executed by Kim Ki-woo to get each one in his family employed by the Parks. This stretch of street-smarts versus rich-naivety while engaging and funny, still seemed like it was missing the 'element of twist' commonly associated with Bong's films. But what awaits you beyond the first hour is utterly inventive. It's indeed twists-and-thrills galore, with performances by every single cast member rising to the occasion. Parasite, as a film, should claim a rightful genre to itself. It's a masterful blend of so many genres: comedy, family, drama (plenty of it), survival thriller, satire, horror (rarely), and many more. The social inequality trope isn't used for stirring extra sentiment. Instead, Bong cleverly plays around the concept and shows how intelligent film-makers can tell a story revolving around every section of the society without pandering to either. Most of all, Bong's attention to detail is impeccable and this pays off in several scenes. The film boasts several scenes (not moments, scenes altogether) that are worthy of further discussion. The subtext is impressively underplayed, with the second hour leaving no stone unturned. The climax is the best thing about Parasite (as is the case with most of Bong's movies) and it makes a giant statement - both in terms of storytelling and as a cinematic finale. Parasite is the kind of film that needs multiple viewings; a second or a third viewing will reveal even greater context about each of the meticulously-created characters."

Parasite has a quite unique style and tempo in telling its story. Most spectators, while watching the first half of the film, might well mistake it for a comedy that depicts life of a bunch of jobless social dregs. Well, the plot took some drastic turns when the parasite family lodged happily in the mansion of their employer. The second half is full of vehement conflicts, as if the masks that helped hide the impassable gap between their classes has suddenly disappeared. The stench felt by the couple is all too metaphoric. Educated and civilized as they are, the couple still could not withhold the disdain they held for the lower class in the social hierarchy. Clash of different identities finally turned into a catastrophe. Impoverished people, despite trying every means they are able to get hold of, be it wily tricks or honest labor, will always feel out of place up high on the social ladder. Maybe drinking beers in the damp and dark corner will be a happier ending than to spend life in disguise and despair."

Bong Joon Ho jokes and discusses the disparities between rich and poor through a family that uses every subterfuge and trickery to be part of a higher layer of society. But once infiltrated, they realize that they are still considered second-class, even for the aroma they emanate. A great cast that enhances even further the strong plot.

I really didn't know what to expect because every time I asked someone what it was about, no one could explain it, and now that I've watched it, I can totally understand why. I deliberately waited for the UK Steelbook release because I was hoping that it would come with an English dubbed version, which it didn't so I wasn't happy when I saw I had to read subtitles all the way through. I can honestly say, it wouldn't have worked with a dubbed version because of there expressions and tones. Now, after the first 15 minutes, I didn't know where the movie was going, and I personally thought that the rock was going to have some mystical and magical powers, but it's SO cleverly written and full of surprises throughout, and I'm glad that I didn't know what was going to happen. The acting is top class, and with the storyline being based around 2 families, in two houses, it proves that you don't need a massive budget to produce something special. A lot of people think that 1971 deserved the Oscar for best picture, but after watching this film it beats it hands down for its originality, acting and pure suspense. The amazing twists and turns, mixed with comedy and emotion, was put together extremely well, and you couldn't help but feel for the family who used their brains to get out of the gutter. There are little touches of genius, like the smell aspect of the storyline, and the way that the dad could turn on a switch of a button, which all come's together by the end of the film. Anyway, I fully recommend this movie to all moviegoers, except for kids of course, and I hope that people will give it a chance because you will be surprised with the outcome. Brilliant! Round-Up: This movie was directed by Bong Joon Ho, who also brought you Barking Dogs Never Bite in 2000, Memories of Murder, The Host, Tokyo!, Mother, Snowpiercer and Okja. The only movie that I have seen from his previous work, was Snowpiercer, which I wasn't that impressed with, but this film was unique and a touch of class. It's not often that I agree with the Oscar's panel, but in this case, I did. It won 4 awards, including Best Picture, Best International Film, Best Writing and Best Directing at the 2019 Awards Ceremony, and it's the first Non-English film to win an Oscar in the Best Picture category. Truly Deserved! It covers all genres, which is extremely rare, and the message about different classes is relevant to what is happening around the world today."

I would put this one on the same level as ""Knives Out"" or for example, a great film all around, entertaining, thought provoking, funny, easily digestible and memorable, but even with all those positives, I would not say its better than, for some examples, The Departed, Whiplash, Casablanca, Good Will Hunting. Lawrence of Arabia, Wolf of Wallstreet, even Three Billboards etc. Although to be fair there are many films with an 8+ average that should not be as high as they are either like Joker, and even som 7's that deserve to be 8+ like Tenet, it was just a little hard to grasp everything with 1 view and no subtitles, or Babylon, which was crazy, but it was also beautiful in it's own way. Anyway I am getting a little off the rails but the point is that when I saw it as number 36 in IMDBs top 250 it feels unfair for many other films that may be a littler harder to digest for the average person, but have a lot more substance. Is it a good film? Yes it is a great film, definitely recommended for just about anyone, but is it top 40 of all time? No, perhaps top 40 of it's decade at best but as someone who has watched a lot of films, I seriously doubt it would even be top 100, maybe top 150."

A beautiful shot movie that takes you through the struggles of a downtrodden Kim family trying to meet ends. For them, everyday is a battle for survival. During these struggles, they come across the Park Family.. Initially you meet the naive wife, who can't pick on any lies. She gives access to one of the Kim. And one after another the Kim's systematically encroach all household activities of Park household.. Ofcourse Lies, forgery and greed are the themes running in the background...but mostly this movie is a sharp satire on Class divide.. There are a lot of surprise elements in this movie and it does catch you off-guard. Especially, when the old caretaker (who btw has been removed by the Kim's through careful planning) , requests to enter the house for a very hideous purpose. The architecture of the house itself is beautiful. The stairs are used to good effects. Director conveys a lot through the different stairs and windows in this little tale.. also no tiny detail in this movie is there by chance, it is there for a purpose.. which is what makes this movie even more interesting... It is like an artwork, which on surface might just be telling one story but inside... It holds a lot... So it is basically, on the viewer, what he/she makes of it. Wonderful watch. P.S - As an indian watching a Korean movie, the language is tad distracting but still with subtitles, it is a comfortable watch."

Unlike those popular films that those days create a buzz because of the action plot and the big names, Parasite is more about the social message that it wants to pass through than a likable story that will appear to the masses. So, overall, Parasite is good. If you like movies about real people, that are not afraid to show the raw reality and social injustice, than watch this one. It is a roller coaster of emotions, with lighter, more comical moments and more thrilling, suspenceful moments. And the film combines them masterfully and everything works well together. The performances were top notch as well. The story, finally, was well paced and interesting."

Well, I'm sorry I don't think so. Not by a long way. It's very professionally made and the main themes of class conflict, social inequality and wealth disparity are hard to miss. But that's the thing; for a film that's won an Oscar for best screenplay, there's precious little subtlety or nuance on show. Mrs Park is simply depicted as an air-headed social matriarch, with Mr Park, who's supposedly had the brains and initiative to start up a successful multi-national company, not much better. The Kims on the other all seem exceedingly bright, sharp as tacks, in spite of their living conditions which can only be described as basement third world in a first world economy. I'm not doubting the existence of the banjiha, but seeing the Kims continually lob up to work, so fashionably and immaculately dressed in clean pressed clothes and so intelligently well-spoken hardly rings true. This is before and after their abode (and presumably their wardrobes) have been entirely flooded with sewage. For me, all the best storylines generally have more distinctive shading of characters and behaviours; not the absolute stark contrasts between the haves and have nots, on display in Parasite. And I need to emphasise here that I'm talking about intelligences too, not just material possessions and finances. A film such as 1917 dazzled me in places, to the extent, that I was wondering ""how they managed to do such and such a sequence?"" I was entertained by Parasite, but never enthralled, by what many critics were and are still saying is a ""near-perfect"" picture. I can't agree with this sort of summation. Having said that, I must confess to having a leaning towards seeing the black and white edit, that is supposedly going to be on offer later this year. I am intrigued to see whether a look at that might alter my perspective somewhat."

Parasite was already in buzz for sometime which caught my attention and to my surprise turned out to better than expected after seeing it. Parasite tells the story of differences in the mindset between the Upper class and Lower class families which is very much existing in our society. As the name of the film itself, the movie gives a detailed account of how an unemployed family is influenced by the lifestyle of a wealthy rich family and eventually enters into their house only to get the shock of their life. Directed by Bong Joon Ho, who made Snowpiercer and Okja, Parasite boast off characters which you can easily relate to. A poverty driven family comprising of a struggling father, Kim, and mother, tech savvy son and a careless sister - who goes the wrong path to enter the house of a rich family but ultimately face the consequences. The film slowly and eventually picks up as each member from the poor family starts getting the job in the house of rich, by falsely accusing the old staffs. The main drama unfolds when the rich guys go for a vacation and the Kim's family take over the house and celebrate their win. However, they meet with an unfortunate incident when one of the old staff comes back which changes their plan completely. This is where the film kicks-off when the rich guys cut short their trip and plan to come back which leads to series of uninvited events, leading to more excitement and thrills you never expected. If you go the wrong way, you have to face the consequence and that is what the director Bong Joon Ho showed in his film when Kim's loses one of his family member and ultimately face the redemption. Hats of to Bong Joon Ho for creating a beautiful drama with relatable characters, humorous situations and a powerful storyline with a strong message. There are couple of scenes which is executed brilliantly - when two staff families meet at the basement, the flood scene depicting the behavior of Kim's family - Kim picking up in stuff, son grabbing his favourite stone and daughter lighting her cigeratte even though the house is in mess. The beauty of cinema lies in the story-telling and this is where Parasite scores. Technically, Parasite has a wonderful background score with lovely cinematography. Editing is superb, though I felt few scenes could have been trimmed. Art direction is brilliant while dialogues are outstanding."

Director Joon-ho Bong brought us the incredible films 'Memories of Murder', 'The Host', 'Mother', 'Snowpiercer' and 'Okja', and now 'Parasite'. Starting out as a comedy, the film soon reveals itself for what it truly is. This brilliant script has an ingenious set-up, morphing into a full-on, devious thriller. Initially innocent, the antagonist family's plan soon becomes evident as they infiltrate the lives of an unsuspecting wealthy family. At first through subtle, seemingly innocent actions, but becoming increasingly more sinister as their plans fall into place. The film has a few interesting twists. Kang-ho Song is excellent as usual. He is an incredibly versatile actor. I've seen him in comedies, action movies, horrors and thrillers and he simply never disappoints. The setting in the big mansion is really awesome, versus the dilapidated neighborhood the antagonist family comes from. The behavioral differences are also very effectively illustrated. Although some moments might be considered too convenient to be realistic, the execution thereof is excellent, making this yet another classic, unforgettable Korean thriller."

Is it a masterpiece? I am not convinced. The work is multigeneric, with the first half bearing nearly no resemblance to the second half. I suspect that those who found the first half appealing would be, albeit surprised, not necessarily pleased by the second half. On the other hand, people who found the first half to be too slow and perhaps even boring may have loved the action-packed second half. I see the influence of Tarantino in part 2, and the Cohen brothers throughout, which I have been noticing more and more in recent films. Good but not great, given loose ends and dubious stereotypes and nonsequiturs. Great films are perfect, with everything fitting together so that nothing can be removed without making it worse. This creation, in contrast, is more sensationalist. While it is surprising, and no one could guess the ending from the beginning, that is mainly because of the shock effect of scenes such as the sewers spilling out all over during a torrential rainstorm. And, of course the complete switch to an entire different genre."

However, after watching this movie, my friend is confused because she can't point a finger about what's the topic of the movie. Advertised as ""tragicomedy"", Gisaengchung probably doesn't have a firm genre to stand with, since dramedy is heavily used in the first half before continue the movie with more thriller solution. In the surface, we understand what's this movie about. A poor family starts to ""leech"" on a rich family without told that they are one. Some scenes provide laughs and eerie feeling, but it's not escalating until the second half, when more bloody scenes are showing, but not with much explanation. Since the second half aren't that long, I found that as an audience we must dissect the nature of the action, making a real difference than the light first half. When thinking, I slowly understand that this movie is a rich vs poor act that have to be buried because it will makes chaos. The chaos, gives a ""dark"" approach to the theme, but sugarcoated with some tragic and comedy nature of the movie. The dissecting itself what maybe can't swallowed at one time like my friend. Unfortunately, upon having the realization, this movie doesn't give me that much impression like the others say. Nevertheless, it's still a highly recommended viewing option."

It doesn't take long to establish the characters, but does well to give us time to get to know them. It's essentially the tale of two families: the Kim's - Dad Ki-taek (Kang Ho), Mum (Hyae Jin), Son Ki-woo (Woo Shik) & Daughter Ki-jung (So Dam), and the Park's - Dad Dong-ik (Sun Kyun), Mum Yeon-kyo (Yeo Jeong), Son Da-song (Jung) & Daughter Da-hye (Ziso). The Kim's are poor, living in the 'slums', when Ki-woo gets a job tutoring Da-hye at the Park's nice house on the other side of Seoul. Even though there's symmetry in the parents/son/daughter, this isn't an 'Us' scenario, but rather an exploration of class, social status and unconscious biases. There's no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" - just a semi-realistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there. All of the actors are great, with a nice mix of fun and humour, with seriousness and desperation. The twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions - there's a few different ways it could've played out. Not quite a one-location film, but the house does serve as an extra character. Good score and cinematography. The ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet, devastating and hopeful."

Snowpiercer, Okja, and now Parasite. Problem is that they're Bong's perspectives. And he wants to shove it down the audience's throat. And it's again apparent in this movie. It's painfully clear what he's trying to say in this movie... so apparent that it's immature. He's almost telling you what to feel and think at each moment. And this trend in movies thesedays troubles me. In the old days, movies just told a story. And what each audience takes away are all their own and mostly different. What someone got out of Rocky was different that someone else. Now it's all telling you what to feel and what to think. And this trend is evident in games as well. Before, you had to explore and use creativity to solve puzzles and quests. Now, the games all tell you where to go and what to do. People are getting dumber and dumber thanks to these type of games and movies. It's actually opposite of what this movie is trying to say."

It bites you and doesn't let go, ever. Parasite is a Korean film with sub-titles that tells the story of a poor, lower-working class family that is struggling to get by. Father, mother, son, and daughter. They all have the important 'survival' gene that poor people need to get by - street smarts, improvisation, and slick with words. When the son gets asked by a friend to substitute for him as an English teacher to a high school girl in a rich family, the plot takes off. Through outright lies and trickery, the poor family weaves its way into the lives of the rich family, becoming very intertwined in various ways. The father is the ring leader, but he is happy to let his kids get things started. He tries other ways to earn money, none of them very successful. But the kids break thru, and the family thinks they have hit the motherlode with the rich family. Until, the tide turns and soon, they are fighting for their new lives. Everything leads up to a brutal ending that leaves you stunned, sad, breathless, but still a little hopeful. The director does a clear job of showing that the rich family has no clue what it is like to struggle to survive. They live on a hill in a huge house designed by a famous architect, while the poor family lives in a basement apartment that would fit into one of the rich family's rooms. There is a terrible scene during a heavy rainfall that highlights the plight of the poor. The director strongly shows you that the rich family worries are about things that the poor can't even conceive of worrying about because they are struggling to survive. The rich vs poor dichotomy permeates the film in every scene. This film is about survival and about the struggles of the lower class vs how the rich live in their own world that can't even stand the smell of poverty. You see that theme played out in several different scenes. The cinematography does a great job of showing closeup facial expressions and camera angles so you are in the scene, either in the poverty or in the rich. Certain scenes were too dark and I could not easily tell what was happening. This made me think of Transformer movies where robots fight but you can't tell who is who or who is winning. The absolute star of the film is the rich family's wife. She is a terrific actress. Her character is the epitome of the deluded wealthy who have to find problems where there are none, and who is easily tricked out of her money. But she doesn't care because money is like air to her."

Initially, the title and cover image might suggest a horror film about a literal parasite, but the reality is a fascinating exploration of social dynamics and human ingenuity. Mise-en-Scène: (4/5) The film shines in its use of mise-en-scène, where the contrast between the Park family's luxurious home and the Kim family's modest apartment vividly illustrates the socioeconomic divide. The design of each setting not only enhances the story but also visually reinforces the themes of class disparity. The careful attention to detail in the set design, costumes, and props creates a powerful visual narrative that adds depth to the film's exploration of social issues. Sound Design: (5/5) The sound design in Parasite significantly enriches the viewing experience. The film's score and sound effects are meticulously chosen to complement the mood and enhance the narrative. The transition from light-hearted to more intense music effectively heightens tension and underscores the film's emotional shifts.

This pivotal moment serves as a turning point in the film, unraveling a complex web of secrets and escalating the tension to new heights. Why It Stands Out: Surprising Twist: The basement revelation is a masterful plot twist that completely changes the dynamics of the story. Up until this point, the narrative follows the Kim family's strategic infiltration of the wealthy Park household. The discovery of the basement, and the people hiding within it, adds an unexpected layer of complexity and intrigue. Character Reactions: The reactions of the characters during this scene are incredibly well-acted and authentic. The shock and horror of the Kim family, the desperation of the former housekeeper, and the obliviousness of the Park family create a dramatic and multifaceted interaction that heightens the tension."

Personally, I consider cinema artful when it lays by the wayside, experiences that are commonly available to us, and thereafter presents a narrative that defies such common experiences. Poor people smelling funny was one of the reasons some of my national law school acquaintances wouldn't ride the delhi metro - something that agitated me, but far from such behaviour being a 'morbid distaste for the poor' as the film's leftist reviewers would point out - it's merely an outcome of their socio-economic realities where their lifestyles are cocooned. It's nothing that is maliciously intentioned. That's why, Parasite failed to enthuse me as much as it seemed to have enlivened reviewers to become a concert of uniform appreciation. I take that to be more a sign of the Marxist class consciousness becoming mainstream in our times than a sincere and objective appreciation of the cinematic mode. It should be said that the rising popularity of such class consciousness could have made it possible for both - such a theme to be adapted for the screen, and for the reviewers to overlook the lack of artfulness. Far from 'shocking' and 'emotionally riveting' ending that induces gasps as per The Guardian's film reviewers, the film lazily climaxes through a chaotic ending and tries to paper over the dangerous rationalization of poor people engaging in lies, deceit, and violence against the rich. Criminal and unethical behaviour is not warranted against anyone - irrespective of any markers of personal identity. Half-way through the reel, the film did issue a poser: another one of the common experiences I spoke of earlier - whether 'niceness' is a result of being 'financially well-off'? As answers to that poser, the poor husband and his wife held opposing views in a binary. However, the film does not even try to portray any tension in any of the characters with respect to that binary. The characters were straightjacketed into fixed outlooks on life - with the poor father redeeming his crookedness only after being at the receiving end of pain. Without further deliberation or exposition of that poser, one would tend to think that it was inserted more for effect than as part of a well thought out thematic tapestry. In fact, I find it shocking that review after review imagines the film to be an exegesis of the growing inequality, class divide, and immobility of social classes."

The most important thing about this movie is its message. It's about the Kim family living their harsh life in South Korea as they are without a job and without any perspective. On the opposite there is the Park Family living a privileged life in their luxurious home. By coincidence both lives get tangled up and there are apparently two worlds colliding. The story is very witty and the movie is sometimes funny, sometimes dark but never boring. For me this movie is quite entertaining but not that mind-blowing as some might think."

This is a funny, almost silly story with great acting, and with a couple of twists that make it inventive. It's also filmed (photographed) with gorgeous care, lots of gently moving camera, a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually. It's an example of classic great moviemaking. I thought the acting was especially sharp, like the complex job the leading woman, Yeo-jeong Jo, had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea. And the rest of the cast played types that didn't tumble into stereotypes. The story was smart enough to give them room to be complex, but this isn't a probing complex movie, actually. The content is in the improbable situation and how it leads, almost in a Chaplin-like building of absurdities, to comic tension. The cameraman, Kyung-pyo Hong, deserves credit, for sure, because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenes-racing down dingy steps, a downpour in the slums, and graceful geometry in the fabulous house. Director Bong Joon Ho deserves the praise he is getting. That said, the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise it's been getting: there are more impressive movies out there in various ways. Even just this year there are movies that have movied me more, or made me laugh more, or were more inventive. (I'm not naming movies.) Maybe since this movie manages all three it's notable, but I'll keep my admiration in place! Enjoy it!"

An unemployed family of 4 infiltrate into a rich family's household."

The mix of styles makes Bong Joon Ho's direction unique and magical, mixing thriller with dark comedy, drama, horror and several other genres. The performance of the entire cast is fundamental to the composition of the work, with each actor delivering very convincing and striking performances, especially the main family. The frames presented in the scenes are incredible and memorable, creating an atmosphere of total immersion for the viewer. During the second act, the film marks a transition in atmosphere, turning more towards a thriller, although it maintains the acid comedy at certain moments, with a notable melancholic aura. More than a simple film, the plot presents clear criticisms of class division, the toxic interdependence between rich and poor, and socioeconomic inequalities in South Korea, illustrating two families that follow completely different worlds, even though they coexist in the same society. ""Gisaengchung"" is indispensable for any fan of out-of-the-box works, being yet another great milestone for talented South Korean cinema."

It simply would not have been my choice. Straight off the bat, the cinematography paired with the color scheme and score pulled me in. Much of the music in the film was haunting and effective, though at times, it fell completely flat, indulging in string clichés, which seemed to contradict the original nature of Parasite. Parasite is unlike any film I've seen in several regards. It takes a while for the plot to settle in. It's rather special as the circumstances unravel. It is genre-bending and defying. The film shifts in tone several times, which I found refreshing. However, I was both indifferent and negative in response to integral directions taken in the final act. I appreciate that every single character was flawed and that many of our protagonists were irredeemable. Slow burns are my favorite type of film. The pacing was mostly tolerable, though I do believe in being slightly condensed, it would be improved. The ending dragged out. We can gather much from what is told in one word. There were many moments that felt like watching a trailer of a greater film in part due to sound mixing, which was disappointing. If the editing was improved upon, I, again, would have enjoyed it more. Stylistically, for the most part, Parasite is brilliant. Sure, it may have its faults, but it is still worlds upon worlds better than your average film. Does it align with my preferences? Mostly yes, but not entirely. If I preferred the directions taken, it would lean towards an 8 or perhaps even a 9 as the film is built on a remarkable foundation that I truly have never seen done before; it's frankly inspirational. If there were some different decisions made and some of the editing was improved upon, again, I likely would have bumped this up to an 8 or a 9. To most, Parasite is a masterpiece, and understandably so. On a technical basis, I am inclined to agree. I recommend Parasite! :)"

While the successful live a peaceful life, those with less money are living in precarious conditions. The rich cannot tarnish their image as good people and the poor need to pretend to be from a higher class to fit in among them. Parasite is an obvious criticism, but with subtexts that can generate several debates. The film shines by playing with different genres throughout the plot and carrying them out in an excellent way. Comedy, horror, drama, action and suspense are mixed in an extremely effective way, projecting a mix of emotions to the viewer, but never in a confusing way. Parasite is one of the greatest works of the 21st century. An excellent review, an excellent film and a modern classic."

It is undeniable that Bong Joon Ho led the warship masterfully through the abyss of the genre & I do believe that should be pointed out. However, the reason the movie is a 7 & not a 10 is pretty much because the story is simply okay. The movie shines at its best when it goes into the grey areas, talking about rich people being so nice because they are rich & not making the movie about the idiotic correlation between wealth & evil. Yet, it falls short on that regard since this is what this movie ends up being about. Poor people smell bad & rich people will point in out. Simple. Regressive. Wrong."

(Others have already summarized the plot, so I won't go over that again here.) Indeed, it kept getting stranger and more unpredictable with each new scene. It is, however, also one of the most imaginative and creative films I have seen. I would most certainly recommend it to anyone open-minded enough to handle something that is perpetually unforeseeable. My only problem was the subtitles. I saw the movie tonight here in France with French subtitles. Half the time I could not read the white subtitles against a light or white background. It is so easy to put a black cartouche around the subtitles to make them always readable. Sure, you lose a little of the original image, but that's better than losing your audience for half the picture. Something distributors need to rethink."

It's a good one and the twist knocks the movie into another direction(in a good way). The twist is well timed. And, importantly for me, plausible. It doesn't contradict the whole rest of the movie like so many twists do. This movie is an interesting story that's well told. There's various kinds of tension and it remains engaging. It's also worth noting it's very accessible for a foreign drama film. I watch foreign films all the time but for those who aren't familiar will find it easy to follow and get into. Now this film won the staggering achievement of getting a Best Picture Oscar for a foreign film. Something that hasn't happened before. And I think it does deserve it. There is alot of subtext about class and inequality and money. The movie explores it in an interesting way. Finally, the movie works up to a crescendo of an ending that is really impactful. Highly recommended."

From the beginning until the end of the film the audience was silent, without being distracted, immersed in the reality that the film presents. The script, in terms of structure, works like a clock: the characters, the scenarios, the conflicts are raised, and each element will influence what happens next. The staging is magnificent: an exact combination of photography, editing and direction that manages to maintain attention and tension in each sequence: the way in which each member of the family is gets work at the house, the sequence of the arrival of the family after ""the camp"", the children's party of the climax ... They are very well executed sequences and together they manage to maintain a rhythm as I have rarely seen this year in the cinema. The message of social class difference is clear but very in your face, especially when what happens after the storm is evident. My only buts are that there are parts of the plot that feel forced to cause impact, and although they work, they are not entirely convincing. And that in the cinema I seek to leave inspired, not with my head down, and this film is very entertaining but ends up overwhelming the mood. Even so, for provoking that community experience in a movie theater through the extraordinary use of cinematic language it is worth the recommendation."

Bong Joon-ho uses the architecture of the Parks' house to symbolize this divide, with the Kims literally and figuratively living below the surface, aspiring to rise to the heights of the Parks' opulent lifestyle. The verticality of the set design emphasizes the social ladder that the Kims are attempting to climb. The film explores the corrupting influence of greed. The Kims' initial deception is driven by necessity, but as they become more entrenched in the Parks' lives, their schemes grow more elaborate and morally dubious. The Parks, while not evil, are depicted as oblivious and entitled, highlighting how wealth can insulate individuals from the harsh realities faced by those less fortunate. ""Parasite"" examines how economic status affects relationships. The Parks and the Kims interact within a clear hierarchy, with the Parks often treating the Kims as invisible or less-than-human. However, the relationship between the two families becomes more complex as they are forced to confront their interdependence, culminating in moments of tension and unexpected empathy. The discovery of the hidden basement is a pivotal moment that reveals the hidden lives and secrets of the characters. This basement represents the unseen underclass that supports the comfortable lives of the wealthy. The film's title, ""Parasite,"" alludes to this symbiotic relationship, where both the Kims and the Parks can be seen as parasites in different ways. Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous, employing a range of cinematic techniques to enhance the narrative. The use of space within the Parks' house is particularly notable, with its sleek, modern design contrasting sharply with the cramped, dingy Kim apartment. The camera work often emphasizes this spatial and social divide, using wide shots to showcase the lavishness of the Parks' home and tight, confined angles to depict the Kims' environment. The film's pacing and tone shift dramatically in the second half, moving from dark comedy to intense thriller. This transition is handled deftly, maintaining suspense and emotional engagement. The score by Jung Jae-il complements this shift, with music that underscores the tension and escalating stakes."

The common thread is to object to the impoverished characters as being portrayed as too capable; the ""If you're so smart, why aren't you rich?"" saying being an epitome of this mindset. It's a saying that you could hear in a schoolyard, because it betrays a childish level of understanding, or lack thereof: not considering unearned wealth transfer; not considering the disparity of opportunities; and not considering that the wealth gap is particularly large in South Korea. It's unclear how many people who are willingly ignorant about injustice can be reached at all, but art like this film must help, at the very least by sustaining a discussion of the topic of injustice and inequality."

The direction and photography are impeccable, but perhaps not worth the watch time. While I wanted to see the family get into more hijinks (my favorite act was the 1st), the story decided to sit at this house of rich people (to examine the class divide I imagine), and I was a little disappointed. However, the house holds a few remarkable secrets, and the anxiety I felt watching this family blend in was palpable, and it didn't hurt that the actors had great chemistry and humor going. I also enjoyed how the naturalistic directing style contrasted with the insanity of the last act. Give it a watch!"

The story and its telling are clever, interesting and at times thought provoking. The cast is uniformly fine, not great, but fine. I won't repeat the storyline here as its been told enough but I will speak to elements of it. The poor and clever class and the wealthy and not so bright class are both painted a little broadly and predictably for me. The very bloody, 'Tarantino' like ending was also a bit over the top as well. Still, Bong Joon Ho does a fine job in creating what I think is a fresh and unique film experience definitely worth checking out."

But could they have assumed that someone else had ""dug in"" here for a long time, and he would not give up his place at a full refrigerator so easily... The whole story, full of unexpected twists, tragic outcomes and grotesque caricature, seems to me like a tracing paper that can be applied to many socio-economic cataclysms: from labor migration to civil wars and revolutions. An interesting film, outwardly comedic, full of ABSURDITY, but suggestive of associations."

Calm, controlled camerawork and beautiful cinematography that makes full use of the available light, colour and weather. The story draws you in too. Perhaps a little slowly at first, but it reaches a fantastic climax, navigating through various genres as it gets there. It's an inspired bit of storytelling. But there are a few things that stop it from being a true masterpiece. The first hour is a little too slow. The combination of the subtitles and the low-key performances of several lead characters make it quite hard for a non-Korean speaking viewer to understand their motivations. And the greatest shame is that the final act is unconvincing when compared to what has preceded it. But well worth watching. The second hour is a stunning piece of cinema."

Well, I finally got to the film ""Parasite"", about which there are already so many reviews, despite the fact that the film is completely ""fresh"", 2019. I am not very familiar with Korean cinema, if not to say that I am not familiar with it at all. I'm not fond of dramas - I tried to watch something somehow, but no, everything is too naive and enthusiastic for me. Therefore, to be honest, the film ""Parasite"" also began to watch with a little apprehension - however, what am I risking? If the film doesn't work, if I don't like it, I'll turn it off and start watching something else, there's a big problem. So, as you already understood, the film ""Parasite"" is made in South Korea. I must say right away that, it seems to me, the title of the film does not quite fit the plot, it is somehow wrong, confusing. I would call the film ""Swindlers"", ""Liars"", ""Deceivers"", well, or something like that ... Nevertheless, in Russian the meaning of the word ""parasites"" has a slightly different connotation - in Wiki ""Parasite (trans.) - a person living on other people's means, at the expense of other people's labor, a parasite (social parasite)"". And in the film, the family worked on its own, and therefore earned money relatively honestly. In general, the film is very good - dynamic, sometimes unpredictable. Yes, and the quality of filming, the acting - all this pleased me. I will not retell the plot, but I will say about it very briefly. The guy gets a job in one fairly wealthy family and then, by hook or by crook, drags both his sister and his parents to work there. How it will turn out for both families, you will learn from the film. I can recommend the tape ""Parasite"". But still I don't share the general enthusiasm, for me the film turned out to be a one-off. I looked and even got a portion of the positive. But I definitely won't revise this film, and I'm unlikely to remember it after a couple of months."

D Degree investigation by commentator of True Voice of Taiwan, Dennis Peng Ph. D and American Journalist Michael Richardson. Tsai claims she received 1.5 Ph. D degree from LSE in 1984, but The Council of the London School of Economics and Political Science in a November 26th 2021 statement to British Information Commissioner's Office denies that LSE have Tsai Ing-wen's Ph. D thesis examiners' names and date of examination. Oddly enough that Tsai's application to New York attorney license in 1987 did not even mention that she has 1.5 Ph. D degree from the University. All these evidences point to Tsai never received any Ph. D degree from the University of London neither one, or one and a half. Currently, Taiwanese is prohibited from looking into Tsai higher academic records by an order from Tsai's government; the order seals her records from public eye for thirty years. Dr. Peng is a fugitive wanted by Tsai government and currently in exile in the US. LSE records show, in Tsai's own writing, that Tsai dropped out of LSE Ph. D programme in 1983 because of financial difficulty. She returned to Taiwan and began to fabricate her credentials to gain various higher posts. Tsai's scam came to light in 2015 but failed to wake Taiwanese; this is the timeline when the Korean film maker picked up the story. Soon after Tsai took power, Taiwan's National Communication Commission (NCC) began to clamp down news outlets and shut a TV station to quiet the dissenting voices. Also, Taiwan's Central Election Commission is now run by a Democratic Progressive Party leader known to falsify legal document and the commission is staffed with Eagle Eye troopers who are the most avid supporters of Tsai. The impact of DPP control of the electoral commission is evident by the passages of importing of European Union banned ractopamine-containing pork into Taiwan and destruction of a unique 7500 years coral reef; the destruction of reef carries a huge if not irreversible ecologic impact that may lead to the loss of a global treasure. Every Taiwanese knows the movie Parasite is poking fun at Taiwan for its fame for protecting scammers. Taiwanese strongly objects the Korean film maker publicize President Tsai's scandal and morph her story into a movie for monetary gain and to shame Taiwan. While enjoying the film but I also felt the hurt that Korean pouring on Taiwan."

After settling comfortably in their home, things go awry when the Kim family discovers a secret hidden inside the Parks family home. Directed by Bong Joon-Ho, the film's direction explores economic inequality and social division. The film's symbolism indicates how the Kim family's greed for the wealth of the Parks family is similar to a parasite feeding on larger animals to survive. However, it also suggests how the wealthy also takes advantage of the less fortunate by the abuse of their power. An interesting take on capitalism. The performances from the main cast were entertaining. The performances enhanced the amusing scenes throughout the film. The main cast portraying the Kim family did a brilliant job with their roles as con artists. A thrilling film that blends social consciousness and dark comedy brilliantly."

Um... it's about an out of work family who through a series of events find work and surprising things occur. There is so much to admire about Parasite. The screenplay is so good because, while the setting may be foreign to American audiences, the story is familiar and takes unexpected turns that when you really think about them the turns were always somehow inevitable. The point of view is funny and insightful. The themes once completely revealed are devastatingly universal. A further boon to Parasite is that the cast is great. Each member of the cast gets to shine in their distinct ways. The chemistry is familial and easy. The father played by Song Kang Ho and the daughter played by Park So Dam are the standouts; but, uniformly, each character plays their essential part in this tale. I'll also note how the production design is architecturally awe-inspiring and meticulous. The sets that were built for the film tell just as much of the story by just existing as do the dialogue and the actors. Parasite is an absolute must see. If it is in a theater near you, take the opportunity to enjoy this spectacle on the big screen. Do not read any spoilers. Go into this one knowing as little as possible."

And plunges you into an even more paradoxical situation, in which hatred and fear (which for the entire film remain slightly below the surface) take over, until the last scene that makes you understand the profound dramatic condition in which the family will have to live for years to come."

Parasite is a 2019 South-Korean film, directed by Bong Joon-ho. You might've not heard about tons of Korean movies, but chances are that even someone (such as me) who needs to check out more Korean cinema has still heard something about Parasite. It's the highest grossing South-Korean film of all time, and the first non-English language film to ever win an Oscar for the best picture. The movie follows a poor family and their struggles to make a living. When the son of the family gets an opportunity to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a rich family, he takes the job with no hesitation, lying a bit of light lies regarding his qualifications. Soon he learns that the mother of the family is rather easy to manipulate, and so the poor family begins to plot a scheme to completely infiltrate the household of the rich Parks family. This one has something that I think anyone can appreciate when it comes to art - it's super accessible, but it still has enough depth so one can have an elaborate, film-nerd discussion regarding the film afterwards. Everything in this film just feels so smooth, so fluid and well-done: camera movement, editing, composition, everything just has this good flow that I really appreciate. Certain sequences especially bring that to the front, but it's present all throughout the film and I really love it. There's also a cool blend of genres here - comedy and drama with some heist movie vibes and then, around the halfway point, there's this awesome shift that really get this film going, and in unexpected directions with much more weight to them. It's like there's this whole buildup in the first half of the movie, and then it turns out so abruptly to something darker and more thrilling. Really love this aspect of the movie. Well done. And you know what? Pretty much every aspect of this film is well-done, to the point that I don't think that this film has any notable flaws. It doesn't automatically mean that the film is a 10/10 experience, only that it does what it tries to do in the best way possible, but still - the humor works for me, the acting is spot-on, the story is compelling and the social commentary gives some proper food for thought. This is one of those films that I'd probably recommend anyone who's old enough to watch an R-Rated film. So yeah, this one's very good. Its flow and pacing are super satisfying, everyone's acting is spot-on, and the genres brought to the table here are woven together in a really unique way."

This is a very smart idea without a doubt, but there was a lot of hype because of how much of a thriller it is, which disappointed me because it was not a thriller for me, it was neither terrifying nor playing with Mt mind or something. It had its suspens but it was more of an action/ drama movie. OF COURSE IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE GREAT MOVIE.

I went in basically blind and I hope any future fans do too but if you're not convinced, tight and unique story, very suspenseful, and charming characters.

Even as it is spoken in a language that needs subtitles I had a smile on my face in some situations. But it's also weird what is happening in the basement. I had a bit of problems what is happening in the basement with the lights, it's funny but also a thing you can't believe.

It's one of those films that astonish you and make you think about the film much after it has ended. It studies class divide in a post-modern world and has so many elements to it that one needs to watch a video explaining the film. Sometimes it may feel over-exaggerating, but I can't fault the director for this style, which does truly make him the Kafka of our times. Thank you for the film of the year and congratulations on being the first foreign language film to win the Oscar!"

Playing only in one theater in NYC and it was sold out all weekend. Luckily, I was able to go see an early showing of this film on my day off. The hype is real. I enjoyed this film and was glued to the screen for the entire duration of the film. Its, funny, smart, violent, and socially timely. Whatever, you do please go see Parasite as it is going to be one of the best films of the year and is one of my favorites already. The film is about a poor family who live in a shabby basement and need money and struggle to survive. An opportunity comes for the son of the family as he forges documents and gets a job as a private tutor for a very wealthy family. Soon the rest of his family begin setting up situations where each of them get hired for the family. The family keep their identities hidden but soon come across dark situations and they must go to great lengths to protect their secret and their new found wealth. Bong Jonon-ho's films are usually very well shot and there is no difference here. Everything is so pristine and each small detail tells a story. The script for this film is a mix of comedy and thriller and it works so well. The leading family in this film are desperate and in poverty so you want to identity with them but then you realize that this family do some terrible stuff for their own greed, even if it means hurting innocent people. The film goes into the depths of exploring class differences and the gap between the wealthy and poor. It doesn't matter the country, this is just ever present everywhere. Its underlying and subtle at first but the theme resonates, especially through the patriarch of the family, portrayed by Song Kang-ho. I'm trying to find something to criticize about the film but am struggling to find things I didn't like. It is a fairly long film but it zooms by because of how entertaining it truly is. This is of course the final season of the year and Oscar season is in full swing. Parasite should really be up there with a Best Picture nomination and I'd say is a strong contender for being the best film of the year. Its so mesmerizing in all regards. I might need to check out more South Korean films as I greatly appreciated Burning last year. I'm gonna reiterate, go and see this film. 8.5/10"

The acting is sooo bad. The rich guy walks with his head high, chest puffed up, almost like an animated character while the poor characters are crawling, bend over like Quasimodos ... It's way to much even for a slapstick comedy. It's sort of like GOT, once you discover that everyone on screen is acting really pourly you accept it, and go along with the story. And what a great story. A few minor plotholes but it doesn't matter. The cinematography and set design makes it all worth the while. Definitely watchable. ********"

I thought that I had this movie more or less figured out at the beginning, but it escalated just so damn quickly and turned from a comedy/heist film into a pretty messed up thriller/drama. Like, when it all started up, I was like ""oh, haha, funny comedy about a family scamming their way into the household of a richer family using entertaining and complex tactics, yay"" and then about halfway into the movie my brain just did a hard reset which went something along the lines of ""WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING AND WHAT THE HELL IS THIS MOVIE"" This film is so beautifully original and well-crafted, and throughout the entire thing there were so many levels which spoke truths about classism and the rich-poor divide. Bong Joon Ho is brilliant at creating an air of deadly suspense, and i was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Only after you finish the movie do you realise just how potent and genius that title is - who truly is the parasite? Wait - it's both of them. The cinematography and the clean, modern feel was beautiful visually, and juxtaposed strikingly with the horror I kept seeing. And almost all the time, especially in the second half I had no idea what was happening and I had no idea what came next. And oh, the suspense - the way it was built gave me that sinking feeling in my stomach that something was about to go horribly, horribly wrong. People have got to get over themselves when it comes to subtitles and discover the great foreign films such as this that are out there. -Sasha."

The ending...",2021-02-27,imdb,"'Parasite' is a solid movie through and through. The Kim's devious ""no-plan"" to get themselves from their pitiful subterranean hole into a luxurious lifestyle is a unique one. Where the comedy comes into this movie is that they never think it through as is their intention, but their fumbles don't matter because the Parks are so gullible to begin with. Yeo-jung Cho's acting gives the best portrayal of anxiety and naivety that allows the audience to understand why the ""no-plan"" is so successful. And it's Kang-ho Song's positive and respectful Ki Taek, who absolutely steers the family ship, that makes the Kim's situation relatable and their deception forgivable. I will say that the ending, albeit catastrophic, did and yet didn't grip me. I doubt many feel the way I do about it. Maybe because as lovable as the Kims were, they were not innocent. The good times couldn't last forever. No lie of that magnitude survives long. And karma came for them horribly. While all the events of the finale did grip me in its moral context and its tragic somberness, when the film was over the lasting impression wasn't there because I felt the family that played with matches got burned as expected. But it's still poetic and still a beautiful film."

I thought they were comic comedies. After the men in the basement came out, I thought six people would live together. I didn't expect that the plot would suddenly change. The director had to lead a story without any sense of reality to the cruelty of realism. As a result, it became more and more painful. The last one was especially stiff. Selina said there was a smell of death in the poor. The film's depiction of the poor is not as accurate and powerful as this sentence."

It's really ingenious. It's a very good story. It's linked up and reversed. The performance of the actors is also excellent. But in the end, it fell into the routine of Korean movie. Now I can understand why the director said he can't play through, because if the play through, the visibility of the film will be greatly reduced. Satire, cold humor, and Reflections on social issues are all felt. But I'm sorry, it's not the palms I'm looking forward to."

Breathing the air in the darkroom can only walk like a ghost. Holding the poor stone for life can't get rid of it, and catching the cheap smell can't get rid of it forever. The bedbugs crouching in the ground can be sterilized by medicine windows, and the hosts on the high ground can hire people to sterilize themselves with money.

It can even be said that uncle Kim's family is very grateful to representative park and thinks that Mrs. Park is simple and kind. The rich couple, on the other hand, did not specifically target the other class of people with any deliberately difficult and contemptuous.

After hearing so much buzz about this film at the Oscars, somehow I still had no idea what the movie was about going into it.A great moment for Korean cinema and an extremely thought provoking film. Parasite tells the story of the Kim family and their life-changing involvement with the Park family. If you want to be told a story, but without too much detail upfront that would give it all away, sit down for this one.Boong Joon Ho directs this Oscar winning movie about the disreputable behaviour of a Korean family who infiltrate the home and lives of a wealthy couple by gradually taking over the roles of domestic helpers.The Parks family is the opposite of all of this.Naive,not so much - probably just out of touch with the real world. The first hour of the movie it was more of a comedy but after that everything changed.The whole ambiance changed, and I was literally shook all the time after that happened. The actors were great, the plot was super strong, and I can't say enough good things about how beautiful this film is just to look at.Though I really did enjoy the film, I personally, didn't think this deserved the Oscar win for best movie as although a strong and powerful tale, for me, there were better films in the preceding year. I also do not think this is the best of Boong Joon Ho's movies. However, the fact that it did win is to be applauded as a massive step forward in the recognition that there are movies made outside Hollywood. It isn't an easy ride, and as with life in the real world, the destination is always uncertain. You'll see strange and wonderful things along the way. Parasite also perfectly presents the subject of classism, showing us how both the working class and the upper class view each other and the people around them. Taking everything into account,Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece."

In the end, your father killed the little girl 's dad. At the end, he was still completely regretful. He did n't lose the little girl. Then this layer of class gaps and gaps that are determined by social status and money need not be portrayed. Such an explicit irony is only ironic. Such a direct description not only does not perfectly show the poverty at the bottom of this society.

On one side is the icy and hard stadium and on the other is the luxurious soft back garden. Money is an iron, which irons everything.

If you are rich, there must be richer than you; if you are poor, there must be poorer than you. The gap between the rich and the poor is like countless walls that divide people into three, six, and nine. This wall, standing in the wind, the sun and the rain, stood still. The Park couple looked stupid, but they were still getting richer and richer; the Kim Ji-zee family was clever but couldn't stand up. You thought you could get a good job, get a good salary, and get rid of your poverty status. You can wash off the sweat of your clothes, but you can't wash off the smell of the basement that is already in the blood.

This movie was different in the sense that it played with your mind having a story unpredictable. Parasite is also a reflect of society, our worst fear is ourselves and the system we have constructed. We are always trying to get more and more and sometimes we aren't able to see the risks until you loose it all. That's why I liked all the outcome that reflects what our reality is, anyways the result of all the problems was something not really convincing to me. The possibilities to get to that end are one in one million, so I think even a better ending would be too keep this real idea that things not always end up as we want. The movie in general was really well made, the way Bong Joon Ho thought about every scene and detail is surprising."

I really don't see how this movie won the Oscar when Jordan Peele's ""Us"", a movie with VERY similar themes, but much more well put together, wasn't even nominated. The ""message"" of the film is rather evil and misinterpretable; we're talking about a country that only has the money to make this sort of cinema because economic liberalism built it from the disgrace it was in the past century. The poor family's father's reaction to his boss disliking his smell, in the privacy of his home, is ridiculous."

It's in that classic Oscar winning style of being quite artsy and something totally un-blockbuster like. These are always going to be movies that are enjoyable and have a great story to tell rather than just being about a feast of action for the eyes. Parasite has such a strange mix of humour and horror towards the end. Overall the biggest takeaway is the contrast between rich and poor. It takes you through such a stark contrast and the perceptions of both sides. The flood was a great example, for one family a bit of fun, for another you lose everything you own. In the end, we cannot assume that we would not behave in similar ways when we have had everything taken away from us and we are losing our lives. Quirky, but interesting."

I will not say that 'Parasite' is not worthy of all these awards, but considering all the hype - I expected something, I don't know, more. Do I think that the film is overrated, or underrated doesn't matter? What matters, is that 'Parasite' is a wonderful movie. I must give the highest praise to the actors. The story was intriguing with several layers, and it contained some unpredictable twists and turns along the way. I have a hard time to find perfect words to praise the cinematography - the camera (literally) danced with the actors and with the story. Yet, it was all so subtle that if you just didn't turn your attention to awe at the cinematography, you almost didn't notice it. Same thing with editing. The magnificent aspect was also the way the story was told - it started like absurdist comedy, then turned to quite spicy satire, then all of the sudden gory thriller and then ending this all with a nice touch of morale, but without preaching. The change in the atmosphere didn't ruin the pace or make the film lose its focus. The characters were clear, each one of them perfectly fleshed out. At least, the best original screenplay award is well earned. Besides being visually poetical and masterfully acted, the movie raises some poignant questions. People praise how good of overview 'Parasite' gives on South-Korean society, but to be honest - all the 'First World' countries are dealing with the same problems. No matter which economical class we are, people ale too self-absorbed, that they don't see the faults in themselves - everything is someone else's fault. While different people struggling for the same goal, rather than becoming allies and work together, they start to compete, and that usually means, that both sides will lose (that is just philosophizing, it is not a spoiler). Was it the most important film in 2019? Well, I don't know, because I haven't seen most of them, but 'Parasite' is most definitely a rare masterpiece that can be entertaining and what most important, thought-provoking at the same time."

The characters walk on such a fine line when trying to keep the other family fooled by their act that the film contains some of the most tense moments I have ever seen. The desperation and the lengths at which they go to left me in awe and made me question if their aim was still, if ever, worth it.

What in the world? Why was everyone SO HYPED about this? Yes its good, but its not even ""Get Out"" good. We follow an awful family of financial parasites (the movie should have been called ""Parasites"", much more apt), and while I didn't necessarily see the ""twists"" coming, they were so natural that they weren't surprises so much as they were just things that made sense. I don't think Americans are able to gauge good quality of entertainment (see any reality tv show). While this is good, it shouldn't have taken America by storm like it did. This should be a bar for movies to reach (and honestly it shouldn't be so hard to get on the same level as this movie: we just lack originality and substance over...explosions and punching). The main thing that makes this movie good is that there are no heroes (from the very beginning, it is established that the protagonists are awful), but those with and those without, and it doesn't seem to matter how you get what you get as long as you get it. And while Americans are going to go wild relating to wronging their peers to get by, the focus is on ""take from the rich"" so a crude lens is going to justify their actions when its still legally and morally wrong, but there is a capitalistic mindset that just sees the survival and the gains as a win. This movie has some depth and substance to it that you don't normally see from America, and this is one that is worth the read."

Not because it isn't incredibly well-made, acted etc. I've seen some bad reviews of it which I don't agree with, but I understand where they are coming from. Because at no point is the audience given even the slightest hint about why any of this is happening. Why are this rich family hiring an art tutor for their eight year old? They must have more money sense. Rich people are stupid. Look at this smart but poor family taking advantage, it's all good. Well no it isn't actually. Scamming is a massive issue in Korea. Voice-phishing, molka cams, car insurance scams are an absolute plague and they are, in many ways, uniquely korean issues. But that isn't why this movie leaves a bad taste. At no point is it addressed why this family would need to be hiring tutors for their kids. This is a very Korean issue, and it isn't something that is exclusive to rich people. It is in fact the norm. It's just much easier when you're rich because no personal sacrifices need to be made. Maths tutors for 4 year olds. Piano teachers. Ballet lessons. Learning 3 or 4 languages. This actually happens. Yes at 4 years old. So an art tutor for an 8 year old really isn't anything to bat an eyelid about if you live in Korea. Which is why most young Koreans would do anything to live in Europe or the US, it's just a constant grind every single day. This isn't a film about inequality. In fact, Korea is well down the list of most unequal societies. Elderly poverty is a big problem in Korea. Inequality is not. Seoul is just a city, like London or New York or San Francisco that has very expensive districts and houses/apartments. But unlike those other cities, schooling is a large part of the reason for that. Everything comes back to education yet here we are blaming it on 'inequality'. It's fashionable of course. There's always something with the best picture oscar these past few years. Anyway, it's good to see a Korean movie doing so well. I would rather it have been Old Boy winning the big awards but I have no issue with this kind of entertaining fluff winning awards. Korea deserves recognition as they are producing some fantastic TV and films."

And that's exactly the best thing about the film. A thriller story between rich and poor that is pretty well written. As such, I personally found the staging to be rather standard. But the end is worth it in my opinion. The film is rather calm, but the end is all the more shocking and blatant. The acting is solid. The poor family is easy to find, even though it embodies evil. The development of family behavior is scary. If you know the core of the story at the end, the film title makes a very good sense. In my opinion, Parasite wasn't the best film of the year. But worth seeing. Mostly because of the story."

It had a plot that instantly drew me in and characters that were easy to root for. It told a difficult tale about class struggle without turning the main characters into 2-dimensional heroes. It even ended with an unexpected intensity that I seriously doubt anyone saw coming. All of that said, it underwhelmed me. It repeated things over and over again, which was a plot device, but made some parts really drag. Moreover, the film's failure to assign winners and losers in its conclusion made it intriguing, but also left each character unlikeable- and when all the characters end up being unlikeable, it kind of leaves you feeling like the time you just invested was somewhat meaningless. I probably wouldn't feel that way if I had gone into it with no expectations- I may only focus on the good, but unfortunately I only watched it after everyone said it was the best film of the year and after it became the first foreign film to win best picture at the Oscars. I can only pass along my own, subjective experience, and that was it. 🤷‍♂️"

This question popped into my head after I finished Bong Joon Ho's Parasite and as I read some snippets from Bong himself. He consistently refers to the film as a tragedy, and, as I wondered who the antagonist was, I remembered that in Greek tragedy, the fall of the hero always stems from a flaw within themselves. Then the answer clicked. The antagonists are the Kims. So, the Kims are a poor family of four, struggling to make a living in Seoul and conning their way into life's niceties. In the opening scene, we see them clamor up to the corner of their bathroom (where their toilet is elevated above the rest of the room) to steal wifi after their upstairs neighbors put a password on theirs. The son, Dong Ik, gets an offer from a friend to cover for him as an English tutor to a daughter of a wealthy family. Dong Ik uses his position to get one for his sister as an art teacher/therapist for the younger child, a position driving the patriarch for his father, and the position of housekeeper for his mother. The first two positions are simply open and require nothing more than convincing the mother of the house to give them a shot, but the house already has a driver and a housekeeper. And that is where the con takes another level. Ki Jung leaves her underwear in the car when the driver drives her home, creating the impression, when the patriarch finds them, that the driver was having sex with women in his car. He gets let go, replaced by Ki Taek, Dong Ik's father. To get rid of the housekeeper requires more planning, since she had been with the house from the house's previous owner. They end up having to take extreme measures which include convincing the mother of the house that the housekeeper has tuberculosis and triggering the housekeeper's life-threatening allergy to peach fuzz. The Kims are not good people. They're deceptive, cruel, and dishonest. The Parks, on the other hand, are a mixture of detached, thoughtless, and unfeeling. They're not really good people either. They dismiss the driver without asking him about the underwear, fully believing the worst of him based on a single piece of evidence while discounting all the time they have spent with him. They cast off the housekeeper without even asking her if she actually as tuberculosis. The key is that both groups are their own destructive forces. It's hard to get into how that manifests late in the film (essentially past the halfway point) without digging into spoilers, so I'll speak in generalities."

I had no idea where this film was going to go, there was so many different twists changing things up. It's a brilliant film, and the actors all did so well. If I had to fault anything, it would be that I didn't really see a tight family connection between the poor family."

The director is not a genius. The story is not brilliant. The actors/actresses were not wonderful. The director focuses the movie on modern issues with class that we all relate to. You have sympathy for everyone in the movie, from the rich people to the poor. The story isn't exactly believable, but it works to get the point across. The actors and actresses all did well, but to say that much of the acting ranges from wooden to incredible exaggeration is an understatement. So, I felt plenty of emotion watching this movie, and I felt strongly for everyone in it. But, to say that this made me see or feel anything I've never seen or felt before is as exaggerated as some of the hype about this movie. I am not ""born again"" because I was witness to this movie, but it makes you think and reflect on different people that these people remind you of in the real world. Maybe if you are very much like any of the pathetic characters in this movie, and believe me, every one of them is absolutely pathetic, then watching this movie may be like an earth shattering revelation. But, for the vast majority of us who live a very tamped-down version of the existence of one or more of these characters, watching this movie is just a bit like looking in a mirror, causing you to pause and think about yourself and others. And that is always very good. Not great, but very good."

In fact, neither the rich nor the poor in this film are treated like demons or saints - just people intersecting from their opposite ends of the social spectrum and all the chaos that comes with it. Mid-way, the film takes a crazy turn that you do not see coming and it becomes something else entirely. I will not give it away, but Bong Joon-Ho certainly knows how to keep the audience interested in what could have been a low-hanging fruit story about ""social justice."""

These are words used to describe Bong Joon Ho's Parasite. At first a seemingly witty and somewhat-vulgar comedy, it slowly evolves into something much more. The movie is in Korean with English subtitles. While some subtle cultural differences are noticeable, this movie can be enjoyed by Korean and American audiences alike. The movie centers around the lower-class Kim family, consisting of a man and a woman and their young-adult son and daughter. In the beginning, they are just scraping by, assembling pizza boxes for meager pay and living out of a less-than-desirable underground apartment in a run-down neighborhood of urban sprawl. Then one day, their fate changes: the son's friend, who is about to go overseas to study, hands off to him his job working as an English tutor for the high-school aged daughter of the wealthy upper-class Park family. The Parks reside in a remarkably modern house designed by a well-renowned Korean architect. Think the Frank Lloyd Wright of Korea. The house is gated and surrounded by beautiful luscious greenery: a far cry from the run-down apartment of the Kims. The Park family closely resembles the Kims in its composition: a husband, a wife, a son, and a daughter. However, the children are much younger. The young Kim, upon providing a falsified college transcript, is hired on the spot by the remarkably naive lady of house.The house goes on to become the main setting for the rest of the rollercoaster ride that is Parasite. One-by-one, through their crafty use of deception and by playing a few dirty tricks, the rest of the family succeeds in invading their way into employment in the extravagant Kim household. The family rejoices in its new circumstances, having made this elegant house their sanctuary and having turned their financial situation around by milking the cash cow of the Park family. However, this sense of wealth and prosperity proves to be ephemeral as the dark secret of the house soon-after is revealed in a torrential whirlwind of events. This movie made me somewhat envious as to the Kim family's unity. My brothers, parents, and I have never been as close to each other as to what I witnessed in this movie. Even if the motivations of the Kims are ill-willed, I couldn't help but to empathize with the family. Their crude behavior is quite entertaining as well. From my own experience, I have never had to face poverty in the way that they did. Perhaps because of this, my family is not as close to each other as theirs."

One of the strongest - and a Director that I will watch WHATEVER he is Directing - is South Korean auteur Bong Joon-Hoo. His previous efforts (THE HOST, OKJA, SNOWPIERCER, amongst others) were all led by intriguing stories, interesting people and strong visual imagery, so I was very excited for his newest effort, PARASITE. I purposely did not find out too much about this film, for I wanted to be surprised by what was unfolding in front of me. And...I was rewarded, greatly by another intriguing story with interesting people and strong visual imagery. In Korean, with English subtitles, PARASITE follows a lower class Korean family that go to work for a high class Korean family and brings us on a journey for BOTH families. And that's all I'm going to say about it, for to reveal anything else would be to spoil the surprises along the way. But, as is often the case with these types of stories, it is the journey, not the destination that is the treat of this film. Bong Joon-Ho regular Kang-ho Song stars as the Patriarch of the lower class family who, seemingly, is lazy and allergic to ""work"", but that is not really the case. Woo-sik Choi is the son of the lower class family that connects with the daughter of the higher class family and Hye-jin Jang is the matriarch of the lower class family and they both bring sensitivity and strength to their roles. But for me, the real star of this film is So-dam Park as the daughter of this family who turns out to be the heart and the brains of the operation. Director Bong Joon-Ho brings his usual flair to the proceedings, not letting his camera shy away from the seemy underbelly of this society, but not lingering on it either, moving the surprising plot along at a fast (enough) pace to keep you guessing throughout. I see a lot of films, so when I run across a plot that I couldn't tell what was going to come next, it is satisfying. And, satisfying this film is. Some are calling it an ""Oscar Contender"" and I don't think I would go quite that far - the film does drag a bit in the middle. But, if you can handle reading the subtitles, you'll be entertained indeed by the fervent mind of one of the better Directors working in film today. Letter Grade: A- 8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"

I consider the moment when the family sits at the living room and the doorbell rings a chasing point for both the plot and my overall view of the movie. It turned really weird really fast, with some small plot-holes (as of my own perception). I'd give a 9,5 to the 1st half of the movie, to the other half probably a 7. Still, decent movie overall, good acting, interesting idea, nice music and picture...it deserved the oscars it received, no doubt about that. And cinema is indeed a nice way to learn the culture of each country through the stories that are being told every time. I mostly watch European and American movies, so it was very interesting watching a Korean movie, and i did pick up some traces of their culture. Stonks!!!"

It demonstrates Bong reveling in his Hitchcockian command of somewhat Buuelian material. The plot is both meticulously realized and uniquely Korean. Export potential are promising, as are remake opportunities. The film's most daring move is to make a picture in which all of the characters are openly unfeeling. Everyone's all-out self-serving nastiness is supported by a scathing view of South Korea's haves and have-nots.

I thought it was fantastically enjoyable if you want to just simply follow the plot - full of tension and fully fledged characters. There is also an entire other layer that one can see the film through though, so this appeases the thinking crowd too. I must admit that I thought the second layer was not always clear about what it was trying to say. However it is clearly one of those films which is MEANT to raise more questions than it does answers and that is fine (though can be frustrating for some). Ultimately it is one of those films that is difficult to mark down from a technical or artisitic or even entertainment standpoint. However, it has to be said that it is not hugely emotionally affecting. And this is not necessary a fault. But in my opinion for a film to be 10/10, despite its technical brilliance, has to be emotionally affecting and really make you feel something and teach you more about yourself and other humans around you. Parasite doesn't quite do this which stops it form being in my list of favourite films. But I fully respect it is an excellent movie (entertainment) and also an excellent film (art)."

At first, I didn't get to it because of life, then I avoided it because of the hype, then I felt like I needed to wait till the right moment to properly enjoy it but the hype never quite died down, did it? Watching this now, I can't say a bad thing about it. It's brilliantly shot, everything tracks and makes sense on the screen. The story is fascinating and feels fresh and different. The acting is all spot on, even managing to make characters that really shouldn't be likable... Likable. The metaphors laid out are relevant and neither feel like they are assaulting you or like you need an advance degree in film theory to understand. It's all good stuff. So why don't I love this movie? I liked it. I did. But I wanted to come away from it with a sense of awe. I wanted to feel the masterpiece that is Parasite, like the rest of the world seems to have felt it. Instead, I feel like it's good, really good even, but I don't quite get the hype. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say it's probably because I don't connect with the characters all that much, save for one. Everyone else here felt pretty basic to me.

The plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings.

At least once per year, a movie really hits a sweet spot ... something that is fun to watch and not really like anything we've previously seen. Korean filmmaker Bong Joon Ho's latest film is this year's cinematic surprise. It's filled with interesting characters, social commentary, a unique setting, a creative and twisty story, and enough tension that we are left stunned as the end credits roll. There have already been a few excellent movies this year, and this is surely to be a memorable addition to the best of 2019. We first meet the Kims, a family in poverty living in near-squalor in a basement level apartment with one small window. That window is at street level and allows a bit of natural light to leak in, and also provides a too-clear view of drunks targeting the window as they relieve themselves. The family keeps the window open for free fumigation as the city sprayers drive past, in hopes that it will get rid of the pesky stink bug infestation (yes, there is symmetry to this later in the story). The Kim family consists of Dad (Kang-ho Song), Mother (Hye-jin Jang), teenage son Kevin/Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi) and 20-something daughter Jessica/Ki-jung (So-dam Park), and they react strongly when they lose ""free hi-fi"" access from a neighbor's system. The family seems to make just enough money for their next meal despite somehow underperforming at their family job of folding pizza boxes for a local vendor. Fortunes begin to change for the Kims when one of Kevin's friends ask him to take over tutoring a teenage girl for a wealthy family in town. This sets off an ingenious and sometimes quite funny chain of events that result in all four Kim family members working in some capacity for the Parks, the aforementioned wealthy family. The Park's home was designed by a famous architect and it is a stunning modern hillside home with lush garden and a window that stands in stark contrast to that little window in the Kim's city apartment. Mr. Park (Sun-kyun Lee) is a 1% tech titan married to a high-strung woman who is an eternally anxious and over-matched mom (a fantastic Yeo-jeong Jo). Their two kids are lustful teenage daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung) and hyperactive young son Da-song (Hyun-jun Jung). It's fascinating to watch how this family of schemers infiltrates this gullible and vulnerable upper class home, and how they so are easily trusted thanks to photoshop skills, Google, and a street-wise understanding of how to read people."

Though I enjoyed it, I'm not sure I know genuinely know enough about South Korea class systems to be sure that I fully understood it. (Also, I apologise in advance for butchering South Korean Nomenclature in the next paragraph) Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) lives in a subterranean apartment with his family. One day, he is offered the chance to tutor English to Park Da-Hye (Jung Ji-So) the daughter of a wealthy family. Spying the opportunity to exploit the family, Ki-Woo brings in his sister Kim Ki-Jung (Park So-dam) as art tutor to Da-Hye's younger brother. His father, Kim Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) replaces the family's chauffer and most importantly, his mother, Park Chung-sook (Jang Hye-Jin) replaces Gook Moon-gwang (Lee Jung-eun) as the families trusted housekeeper. All is going well for the Kim family, until one night when the Parks are away - the former housekeeper returns and requests access to the basement, to collect something she's left behind. I enjoyed ""Parasite"" a lot. The performances are great. Kim Ki-taek is probably the standout but there really is nobody who lets the film down. The direction and cinematography are excellent. I enjoyed the story, and particular, not knowing exactly where the film was going to go. I'd seen ""The Host"" before, so I know that Boon Joon-Ho is capable of taking his films into B-Movie territory so I had all sorts of potential horror/science fiction plots in mind. I don't feel like the film suffered in the second half although I accept that for some the switch from a confidence trickster movie to more of a revenge thriller might be a bit too much for some. My problem was that I really don't know much about how South Korean society works. I'm assuming that he film is parable about the tiered levels of class and money in Korea. That the ""Parasite"" of the title can be considered both as the Kim family scamming money from the Parks, and the Parks living of the labour of their lower class employees. But again, I feel like I'm guessing this, rather than being sure. That doesn't really affect my appreciation though of an excellent film and a worthy best picture winner this year."

Parasite starts as a sardonic black comedy about the relations between a poor family and a rich one in present day Seoul before veering off in an entirely unexpected, much darker, almost surreal direction. The protagonists are the impoverished Kim family. Dad is a Micawber like optimistic fatalist, who has failed at numerous jobs but always expects something to turn up. Mom is solid and practical, a one-time high school track star, who keeps things together. The mid-20s daughter and college-age son are smart, quick, glib and nervy, willing to do whatever it takes, but they don't seem to have found their footing. They don't always agree, but they stick together. The Kims live in a cramped, squalid basement apartment in the kind of neighborhood where drunks piss in the street. The scrape up a little money folding boxes for neighborhood pizzeria, none too competently. As we meet them, they have just lost free wi-fi because the neighbor upstairs has passworded her router. Dad advises the kids to hold their phones up and move around the apartment to see if they can catch a signal. They do, up on the ledge where the toilet sits. That's Dad's strategy for life in a nutshell. Deliverance arrives in the form of Son's high school buddy Min, now in college. Min has a gig tutoring English to the 15 year old daughter of a very rich family. He's going to study abroad for a year, and he wants Son to hold his place till he gets back. Min intends to start dating the girl when she's old enough, and he figures Son will be a harmless substitute. Son did well on the English part of the college entrance exam, and Min assures him that he can bs his way through. The rich family, named Park, live in a gorgeous, spacious modern mansion on a hill, formerly the home of a renowned modern architect who has since moved on to bigger things in Paris. The father is the kind of Korean global businessman who has been the subject of an admiring profile in the New York Times. Mrs. Park is described by Min as ""slow,"" which isn't quite right. She's an oblivious but nice lady, more ornamental than useful, who depends on a middle aged housekeeper and who dotes on and spoils her hyperactive 8 year old son. You might call her street dumb. The same is true of her husband, who knows his way around business but is not as worldly wise as he thinks he is. The Parks are insulated from the realities of everyday life by a thick cushion of money, and they think the world works the way it's supposed to."

Though the movie is not without flaws, such as the perplexing ending with inane logic that makes it hard to follow somewhat despite the shocking turns and twists, the director proves himself to be the master of the filmmaking craft by many years of experience. Toward the ending, I had to think to myself, ""This director (I could not quite remember the name, but will memorize following the end) is a genius...whatta crazy movie"". That is a great compliment to the filmmakers who conjured up the most intricate structure of a thriller that also emphasizes originality. I don't know about the political, social and economical situations of South Korea, but I imagine that the themes conveyed by this movie also applies equitably to Europe, Australia and North America, without losing the tonal cohesion and heart-rending message of supposed inequalities. Parasite has to be one of the most original films released in the last decade, and I cannot remember the last time I saw an original movie without it being derivative, mildly, subtly or obvious. It's also the most daring in terms of urgent social messaging under guise of a dark satire worthy of Jonathan Swift's work, on par with ""Joker"". Certainly, Parasite does not warrant the full accolades due to minor flaws that confound the otherwise hypercritical and jaded moviegoers like me, but the effort put into the structure of exposition followed by insane but carefully constructed twists is compelling as a gripping thriller that only this director Bong Joon-ho knows how to pull off effortlessly like the illusionist, and no one else, not even the veteran once-great-turned-hack American directors like Brian De Palma and Michael Mann, can try. Just watch this movie without knowing ANYTHING about the plot. I did not even watch the trailer, and I assiduously avoided reading the reviews prior to this screening. The astonished thrills and incredulous disbelief at the directorial and storytelling ingenuity are worth it by watching this film blind without advance knowledge. *** 1/2"

The class struggle between the upper and lower echelons of society (in this case the rich and their servants), is a common concept in most Asian societies and placing this dilemma at the heart of the plot is, in my opinion, its undoing. Although the idea itself is worth exploring through a work of art, it lacks the striking, bizarre and mystifying elements that make other thriller flicks appealing. Perhaps my misgivings about the movie are mainly a consequence of my expectation that the plot would contain some major twist and supply a mind-blowing climax in the tradition of the classic thriller. Although the tale does end on a violent note, it is far from being unpredictable and even a fairly attentive viewer could foresee a similar denouement halfway through the film. More of a satirical drama than a wild ride, Parasite moves at a rather sedate pace, and the clever con tricks that prompt a chuckle in the first act turn predictable and even lose credibility, with most supporting details seeming artificial and contrived. The characters, though well portrayed by a talented cast, suffer the ubiquitous flaw of being agonizingly one dimensional, merely tools in the hands of the director, designed specifically to bring about certain sequences of events. Barring a single incident in the climax of the film, the characters seem to lack a will of their own, the overarching concept of class inequality embodied so perfectly in each person that they appear more like an ensemble of caricatures. Yet praise should be doled out where it is due, and no element of the film deserves more praise than its cinematography. Despite the shortcomings of the plot, the wonderfully filmed scenes make up for them to a certain extent, the symbolic staircases, architectural secrets (wink wink) , floods and lavish garden parties yielding a veritable visual extravaganza. The score ebbs and flows beautifully with the pace of the film and complements each scene powerfully. In summary, despite deserving some credit as a timely black satire, if a good old crime thriller is what you're looking for, Parasite is certainly not up your alley."

It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th. The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers? In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead. 7/10"

For my viewing experience, there were a number of factors that may well have dampened the overall experience. No matter how you slice it, though, ""Parasite"" is a solid metaphor film that engages both on surface and deep levels. For a very basic overview, this film focuses on two families in South Korea: The Kims are the definition of poor, living in a cramped sub-street level apartment and barely scraping together enough to subside. The Parks are much wealthier, living in a spacious mansion and employee tutors, drivers, and a housekeeper. Through a serious of events both fortuitous and comical, all four Kims become employed (in varying capacities) by the Kims. The juxtaposition between ""clans"" is readily apparent, and brought to an even starker contrast when a momentous discovery changes/defines the entire back half of the film's narrative. On the surface, ""Parasite"" is pretty entertaining, using a multi-genre approach to keep the viewer's interest. While watching, you will be treated to comedy, drama, farce, seriousness, etc. There is never a dull moment, in other words, and the acting is strong throughout. The subtitles only take a few minutes to get used to (from an American viewer perspective) and will quickly become second nature, so don't let that be the reason you may shy away from this movie. More importantly, though, ""Parasite"" is also very much a metaphor movie, dealing with class structures and the fundamentals of capitalism itself. I won't go into spoiler details here, but there are much deeper meanings here than simply what is visually/physically portrayed. Multiple, deeper readings/viewings of the material are very easy to pick out and analyze. Like I said in the opening paragraph, ""Parasite"" may be objectively higher than 7/10 stars. For me, though, it was watched during a nationwide pandemic state, in which it was hard to focus on the issues these filmmakers wanted to put forth. Also, and this is very much a personal preference, I prefer metaphor films to ""sneak up on me"" as opposed to knowing that going in. With this film, though, the cat was out of the bag after the Academy Awards, which is when it will garner the majority of its popular viewings. So, I knew to look for the ""deeper stuff"" from the get-go, and I feel like that may have influenced by overall viewing experience (and perhaps not for the better). So, as of right now, I'm giving ""Parasite"" a 7/10 ranking."

The tone is a tad all over the place, which I'm sure is likely the aim but for me it makes it harder to land that emotional pull to make you really emphasise with the characters. I would argue the film translates to me that family and belonging are the themes to take away. So overall I would say I enjoyed the film and would say go see it for the experience, but if I'm honest I wouldn't choose to add it to my collection."

The only peice that felt out of place for me was the ending which was much too sentimental to fit the movie (I think black comedies are notoriously hard to end fittingly anyway). The 'class' thing plays a role in the movie simply to support it's outrageous plot. True, it surfaces in the end between Mr Park and Kim but it's never explored intellectually enough to hang your hat on. An intriguing plot, plenty of good acting (Song Kang-Ho the pick), some good scripted banter that translated well and some very good cinematography.

So far so good, but the climax of ""Parasite"" its conclusion and its end depart from its very interesting beginning, the director seems to want to change now the tone of his comedy towards drama and / or terror, only to end up losing control of his narrative with a grotesque denouement.

The mood of the movie changed vice-versa and it shook me for some time. A very changing pattern of Korean society and Korean classification was the major essence that I can find in the movie."

imdb2164,movie's poster thriller horror genre wrong drama reality impressed storyline actors performance realness movie add knowledge production south korea dramas similar movie recommend people movie factor missing bit odd planned reading,7,It's a simple message,2020-03-10,imdb,The movie's poster looks like it's going to be a thriller/horror genre but I was wrong. It was more drama and reality. I was not that impressed with the storyline. The actors did a good performance of realness but for me this movie does not really add something new to me knowledge that I would had never thought of. I must say the production was great as South Korea really is known for their Dramas which is similar to this movie. Will definitely recommend people of this movie but for me the x factor is missing and also the ending is a bit odd and not well planned. Thats it for me. Thanks for reading.

Not entirely, but there was so much of Chan-wook Park's The Handmaiden in this movie. Just minus the lesbian story and plus the social commentary on rich and the poor. If you put that aside, it's was a really strange movie for me - the first part of the movie was rather dull, but the second was much intense and even quite shocking. The ending was great and made me think about this movie for few days. So - 7/10."

Bong Joon-ho's directorial brilliance is on full display in this Korean masterpiece, a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of class divisions that seamlessly weaves together dark humor, suspense, and social commentary. From the opening scenes, it captivates with its meticulous attention to detail and visual storytelling. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the Kim family and the opulent luxury of the Park residence. Each frame is a visual feast, contributing to the film's immersive experience. The narrative unfolds with a gripping precision, as the Kim family, struggling in the lower echelons of society, cunningly infiltrates the lives of the wealthy Park family. The plot twists and turns with a surprising and relentless momentum, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. Bong Joon-ho's screenplay is a work of art, seamlessly blending elements of comedy, drama, and thriller into a cohesive and engaging story. Central to the film's success are the stellar performances from the cast. Song Kang-ho leads with a nuanced portrayal of the patriarch, Kim Ki-taek, navigating the complexities of his character with finesse. The entire ensemble, including Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, and Lee Sun-kyun, deliver performances that breathe life into their multifaceted roles, creating a palpable on-screen chemistry. The movie is more than just a suspenseful thriller; it's a profound commentary on societal inequality. Bong Joon-ho skillfully uses the Kim family's strategic infiltration of the Park household as a lens through which to examine the stark contrasts between the haves and the have-nots. The film prompts viewers to reflect on the systemic issues of class disparity and the lengths individuals may go to escape the constraints of poverty. Beyond its social commentary, it also explores the universality of human desires and the consequences of unchecked ambition. The characters, while navigating their respective socio-economic challenges, grapple with themes of morality, identity, and the pursuit of a better life. In conclusion, this is a cinematic triumph, a film that not only entertains but also challenges and provokes thought. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a richly layered narrative, makes it a standout in contemporary cinema."

Yes. Best Picture? No.,2021-01-09,imdb,"Here we have a good example of story telling. The characters are presented in a such a way you can't help but feel empathy for their poor conditions. The characters don't really grow however, they aren't shown at any point to have progressed or have learnt anything, meaning they weren't really used to their full empathetic potential. The cinematography is rather beautiful, and keeps the story moving elegantly. But did it deserve the oscar? No. 1917 ticks every single box. It's enthralling, it's unique, the characters develop, and at the end you're left speechless. At the end of this, I didn't feel much. I'm glad it won the oscar, foreign films deserve high praise and are often overlooked, but i'd watch 1917 again and again and still feel as emotional and captivated, is that not what a best picture is supposed to achieve?"

I have been a fan of slow burners in the past, namely Interstellar and Bladerunner 2049 being two of my favourite films, yet they had arguably much better stories and spectacles throughout to make up for it. I heard Mark Kermode say this film delivers much of its plot visually yet I found the majority of the plot to be delivered with only dialogue or monologue. The supposed climax never really peaked enough, the horror wasn't all that tense or shocking and the comedy didn't land otherwise to carry it through. Furthermore, the references and foreshadowing throughout the film to later events could have been more creative. Finally, the 3rd act and ending felt like it could have been more meaningful and conveyed the Director's discourse with more conviction. Again, I don't want to deny the craftsmanship and deeper thinking into this film. There's some real consideration that's been put into this and a good attempt at making a pertinent and contemporary social commentary. Yet for me, it just didn't work. Nevertheless, I invite you to try this one out for yourself."

Even though the characters weren't in a black or white scheme, i didn't felt connected to something real and the main deceit plot was not that engaging. So its about certain rich people dehumanizing poor people, this was not enough new there for me. This movie could be more for movie lovers who are into artistic shots,novel characters and symbolism."

Now that is not really saying much, as Korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with Chinese, Japanese and Indian films in Asia. But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project."

There are no heroes in this story, just tragic anti-heroes. The first half of the film is a convenient build-up to a spectacular second half. It is a satire that pits the have and have-nots against each other. Morality is lost somewhere in the need for survival. It's a enjoyable film with an unexpected ending. Definitely worth a watch for a Cinema-lover. The subtitles are not hard to follow for a Non-Korean audience. I dropped it from 8 stars to 7 because of some voice-over narration towards the end that was very different from the tone of the rest of the film."

Overall I would definitely recommend watching it, however I really can't understand how it won best picture and best director at the academy awards. In that sense the film is quite mediocre as it doesn't leave a lasting impression as most Oscar winning films do. My guess is the Academy lording diversity at the risk of social criticism."

It's easy to see why it did as well as it did."

The mannerisms of the cast (both the rich socialites and the lowly main characters) is unique to this film, along with the settings used throughout the movie. This not only delivers novel cinematography, but combined with this unique story, Parasite is worth watching for the experience alone. The acting is strong right through the story, with some excellent framing and shot shaping to emphasise certain points. By the end, you can see what got Bong Joon-ho nominated for all these awards - and you would have to agree, he probably deserved to win most of them too."

'Parasite' may be the first foreign language film to win the honor, but it's fair to say it isn't the best foreign language film to make an impression on audiences. Still, there's no denying the cultural impact Bong Joon Ho's dark family thriller has had since making the rounds at film festivals and theater chains. The two families at the center of 'Parasite's plot deserve much credit for what they were able to deliver - a gripping thriller that also serves as a social commentary on modern South Korean society. Aside from the acting, the execution of the plot, filled with more twists and turns than you'd expect from a best picture honoree, is top-notch. And then there's the climax - talk about a series of events that were not expected. Understandably, this earned Ho a ""best original screenplay"" award - and for that, 'Parasite' did deserve the recognition. While it is not the highest quality film released in the past year, 'Parasite' is a edge-of-your-seat, original effort that borrows some of the best elements from previous releases in the genre and takes things to another level."

I came across comments that the film successfully combines almost all genres. I don't know what they were watching, but I was watching a morbid drama about a ""con-artist"" family and social stratification. Comedy, thriller, horror, ... were we watching the same movie. And if someone asked me to recommend him a good South Korean movie, I don't think, in a few months, this one would even come to my mind at all. In a similar fashion, I would probably recommend ""Oldeuboi,"" which, although I saw it a couple of years ago and gave it a seven, I remember as I saw it yesterday. And regardless of the genre, the first association with a South Korean film would definitely be ""A Moment to Remember."" I'm not saying it's not worth a look. Those who love well-shot sickness and modern South Korean cinema should definitely not miss it, but I certainly won't re-watch it. And finally, one question - does the movie's title refer to the Kim family or the Park family ?! I think this is an interesting topic to think about.

I kind of wish Bong Joon Ho called it something else. Since he's done several well-received sci-fi themed movies, I couldn't get it out of my head that ""maybe"" a sub-plot in the movie involved sinister parasites. Nope - it's purely a metaphor. And that's still fine. I liked the movie and was interested to see how it developed. But I wouldn't say it was spine-tinglingly suspenseful, shocking or fully engrossing. There were a couple of plot twists that took the movie in new directions. However, I don't think Ho was able to fully capitalize and leverage the twists after the moment had past. The story is unusual but I didn't find myself having any thought-provoking ideas after the show was over. No doubt it still was interesting to watch the story of two families from different socioeconomic classes interact. It kept my attention throughout it's 2 hour runtime ... but I'd still call it ""good"" ... not ""great""."

On the other side maybe you need to be the part of Korean culture to fully appreciate it, but for me it didn't hold that emotional drama that many other viewers liked. It wasn't that funny in the comedic scenes, and other than the social cass divide which is seen in many other movies it wasnt really deep either.

I think some foreign language films become overrated due to many movie-watchers not being book-readers, or, the novelty of reading whilst 'watching' (glancing up between dialogue) is probably where people are deriving pleasure. You're barely able to watch the film while you're reading the subtitles at the bottom of the screen, so you're unable to judge the acting and cinematography. They're speaking in a foreign language too, so it's impossible to rate the delivery of lines. I doubt this film is rated as highly by Koreans. Parasite is good, quite original, but certainly overrated. The story is reasonably straight forward, and not the mysterious thriller the original trailer advertises it to be. The comedy only exist as humorous moments that can exist in everyday life, whilst the drama isn't believable or impactful. Who is the titular 'parasite'? Well, we can assume all the people working for the wealthy family are the parasites. It's a quick development of the plot when an entire impoverished family rapidly gain employment at the rich family's lavish home through skilled deception, skills which seem unlikely in origin according to earlier scenes. Of course, their new source of income goes off-rails as quickly as it had begun, but certainly not in a deep, 'Hitchcockian', or clever way. Many elements of the film are not fleshed out or are dead ends: The family went from folding pizza boxes to being master conmen; What was the relevance of the ornamental rock?; Why did the young man basically adopt the life of his friend?; Why was it briefly implied the rich man didn't love his wife?; What were the drugs he mentioned he'd buy her?; What became of the boy's deciphered Morse code?; How did the young man send a letter to his father?; Was the end a dream? So, Parasite is not a funny film, and not particularly thrilling, dramatic, clever, or suspenseful. The (music) score is ok, but it's hard to comment on the acting as it's a foreign language movie, and the photography is hard to judge when you're reading the almost non-stop text at the bottom of the screen. There's no particular moral to the story to learn, other than, maybe, not pushing your luck, and tolerating an unpleasant smell. However, from the originality, and what you can discern from the plot, it's still an engaging film - even if that's largely from the novelty of reading subtitles. 7/10 - Not as good as Cinema Paradiso [1988, Director's Cut, 173 min]."

I remember being most unhappy watching his earlier Host (2006) when a perfectly acceptable horror film was interspersed with social comment on the various family members back home. There are great films and great genre films and I can enjoy both but they are different animals. Mr Ho seems to want to do away with the thoughtful script and writing needed for the former and use a mixing of the genre to make up for lack of depth. With Parasite we have, for about an hour, a very decent story building, even if it is becoming more and more far fetched. The big surprise certainly surprised me but not as much as the change that then befall the film and my mind began to wander as all the seriousness fell away. We have a very capable film maker here who needs to get himself a decent script writer. Writing is clearly not his forte and his urge to slip off piste needs, in my opinion, to be restrained so that his wondrous cinematic chemistry can cook away without losing the plot."

Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films, which is saying a lot. You never know where the story is headed so there's a lot of suspense throughout the film. At first, you're given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty. Their wifi doesn't work, their basement dwelling gets flooded, and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door. Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists. That's actually one of the things that bothers me about the film. All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims. I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves. I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did. Poverty isn't enough. Even so, the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged. The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour. After that a curveball is thrown at them, as well as us, the audience. And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset. I'm sorry to point this out again, but it gets irksome. I expected more from the director of the masterpiece, Mother. That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives, even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous. Despite all my criticisms, Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety."

I just didn't think it was as great as everyone else seems to think.,2020-02-24,imdb,"I am going to be unpopular here because it's unfashionable to do anything other than laud Parasite from the rooftops. Let's get a couple of things straight before the off. I have no issue with the 'One inch barriers"" to universal film appreciation that director Bong Joon Ho describes subtitles as. I have seen thousands of subtitled movies and Scandi Noirs. I have no, unlike Mr Trump, political bias against (sorry, not bias, prejudice in Trump's case) South Korean cinema. Indeed I recently reviewed Chan Wook-Park's The Handmaiden as 10 stars on IMDB. (Oldboy is a classic from Park, too.) I also loved Ho's Okja and The Host, although I thought his English-speaking Snowpiercer was truly awful. So this is not the problem, and just because I'm not raving about this doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it, I did. I just feel the praise that's being lavished upon it is greater than my appreciation. I read one review on IMDB by 'mysticfall' that suggested anyone who didn't love this was a moron and clearly didn't understand it. I had no issue with understanding it. It's essentially a movie about class and privilege in which Ho brings together South Korea's richest and poorest in one household, with the poorest as servants, and sets up a scenario where he does not judge either for their caste. Except he does. As the film progresses it's clear that the master of the house has an ingrained prejudice against the poor that manifests itself in his inability to understand or articulate that it's their 'smell' that reeks of poverty, and is therefore undesirable. Variously described as a comedy and horror it leans far more to the former with some extremely funny lines and a pretty strong dose of slapstick - as seen in Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton's excellent Inside Number 9 episode - A Quiet Night In in which two cat-burglars attempt to steal paintings from an occupied house without a word of dialogue. Almost all of Act 2 of Parasite was essentially this episode. The horror that we are promised is actually gore, and is reserved for Act 3. It's very much in the school of Tarantino, and, of course, Tarantino himself is heavily influenced by Asian film-making, so a certain circle is squared. The performances are universally excellent but I feel that, on occasion, Ho strays into slightly heavy-handed territory - much in evidence in his direction of Snowpiercer. It's not enough to spoil anything, but it clashes with the adulatory reviews I've read. The cinematography is simply beautiful."

But at the same time it showed us how it is actually the opposite, the privileged depending on the lower classes in a very disturbing way. The rich generic family needed a 'help' for almost everything in their life. For tutoring the kids(and much more than just tutoring academics), for making food, for supporting the mother who actually has no idea on how to live her life or form an opinion, for driving the father etc and even...for the dynamic between the husband and wife. It showed that most of their conversations were about the 'help'. This is in fact what most of the very privileged people do in society is depend a lot on the people doing work for them, and not see them as actual beings with their own families and lives. It is a form of usage that goes very far and the usage of the underprivileged in a very disproportioned power structure creates a co-dependant relationship. (E.g. The man adoring the master). And many times it costs a lot, for the underprivileged. The poor classes have no choice but to invest so much time in someone else's family, instead of in their own, because they need the salary. The upperclass knows this very well and abuses their power for this. The dynamic of the 'poor' family in the movie was very enjoyable and pulled me in the movie. The story started out very interesting, but - to me - it fell flat towards the end. It could have been so much better , with a better storyline. Im not saying I want a happy ending and definitely am not a lover of clichés. I just wanted it to develop more. It feels that right in the middle of the development of the story it suddenly went flat. A nice movie, i don't care about awards (its all politics anyhow), a good one time watch, and maybe a rewatch to revisit the crazy antics in the beginning and middle of the movie. Favourite character : the poor dad."

The class struggles, the haves and have nots, the disparities, and ""blindness"" of the rich toward the underprivileged and disenchanted, forced to live underground. The""peeing man"" for me, represented the Elvis loving crazy dictator, 45's favorite, potential button pushing maniac, he scares me. Kim Jong-un, who is reckless and careless and pees all over everyone anytime he pleases, yet no one can stop him...sound familiar? This film took satirical chances that we do not always take in American filmmaking. And with an unstable, murderer at the helm of a shaky ship in N. Korea that was bold, very bold. It went everywhere and took us on quite a journey. IMHO, I felt it went to crazy town once the Con Artist family made the underground discovery and then it just crashed through the ceiling at the party. BUT, it made me think and I was compelled to talk about it and wrestle with what I just watched after it was over. Isn't that what film is for?"

What have we here? A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots? Nois. I'll make sure I pay close attention to this one. As expected, this film is good. However it could have easily been bad, if not for the brilliant cinematography, strong directorial sense, and most of all, thought provoking messages and philosophies that don't hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society. However, you aren't here to see me laud, you want to know why I don't hold it in as high regards as everyone else. The film feels messy. Although the comedy is often effective, I don't think it fits well enough in this context. The story is innovative, though it does feel familiar in certain parts. The sudden mood changes aren't my cup of tea as well. A lot of the plot points are just too over the top. They can be distracting. They can be too weird, especially regarding the climax/ending (you'll know what I mean). There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end; or maybe I need more time to think about them, who knows. Lastly, the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in. It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers. At the end of the day I'll still highly recommend this film because, after all it is a good film, and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture. But I'm still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much. I guess I'm not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7/10 rating for The Handmaiden, but this is open to change, and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me, I may learn to like it much more than I do."

I expected to see a movie in line with ""The handmaiden"" (2016, Chan Wook Park) or (an older example) ""The servant"" (1963, Joseph Losey) where the servants gradually take over the power. My expectations where also rather high given the ecxellent South Korean thriller ""Burning"" (2018, Chang Dong Lee) that I saw recently. Both films share the same cinematographer (Kyung Pyo Hong). My expectations where not fulfilled. There is no slow change in the power balance between masters and servants but the cunning servants overwhelm their naive masters in a breathtaking tempo. In this stage the film has a caricatural / comedy element in it that was not to my taste. It is rather difficult to combine the crime and comedy genres, and only the Coen brothers (for example ""Fargo"" 1996) are able to do this job well. One can also see the film in an entirely different way, namely as a social drama about the gap between rich and poor. In ""Parasite"" the rich and the poor are geographically seperated. The poor are living downhill and the rich are living in the upper parts of town. In film such a setting has ancient origins. Think about a classic as ""Metropolis"" (1927, Frits Lang). The subject of the gap between rich and poor is however still actual (think of the writings of the economist Thomas Piketty). At the same time as ""Parasite"" the latest film of Ken Loach was released (""Sorry, we missed you""). In ""Parasite"" the underdogs of society are not so honest as in ""Sorry, we missed you"" and (controray to the combination crime / comedy) the combination social drama / comedy works well. It makes the film less moralizing. I like to mention one element in the film that is easily overlooked but has for me a symbolic meaning. At a certain point in the film the masters notice that their servants all have the same stuffy smell. This smell comes from their damp apartment downtown. The symbolic meaning for me was that the servants are judged after their origin and not after their capabilities. In this way there is no upside social potential and the society becomes static. Success is inheritable. The youngest son of the masters is a bit strange and likes to be in the garden when the rain is pouring.

The poor family appear to be street smart and the rich just more entitled. Slowly the entire family become entwined with the rich based on lie after lie. As the story evolves it become certain that this will not end well - and because of the birthday party, unlike any I have ever seen on screen, that happens. The ending is tragic except for one member - I won't say who. The film is a tragedy on as many levels as there are in the home. The star of the film for me is the home of the rich - confusing writing of the film - one place states it was a set built for the film and another talks about the house as though it was not. I have to be very honest about this film - I would never watch it again. I strongly feel that it probably deserved the international film Oscar. But as for best movie Oscar - no."

imdb2240,film winner palme d'or cannes imagine lengthy standing ovation elite wealthy rich attendees wished laud condemnation ilk reviewers garnered viewing film hand view film balancing act hero villain film questions answers film visual treat portrayal wealthy society poorer culture pays attention detail spaces wonderfully composed scenes framed tempting lost visual details story compelling confusing inconsistent view director unclear wonders final lines contradict clues intent director bong joon ho earlier films snowpiercer host feel ambiguous,7,A Visual Treat,2019-11-19,imdb,"This film was the winner of the Palme D'Or at Cannes. One can imagine a lengthy standing ovation being given by the elite, wealthy, rich attendees who wished to laud this condemnation of their ilk. Clearly, that is what some reviewers garnered from their viewing of this interesting film. But on the other hand, there are others who view this film as a balancing act, where there is no clear hero or villain. As such, it is a film that asks more questions than it answers. One thing is certain: this film is a visual treat. Its portrayal of wealthy society and poorer culture pays great attention to detail. Spaces are wonderfully composed and scenes are so well framed, it is tempting to get lost in the visual details. But there is a story to tell and it is compelling, even if it is sometimes confusing or even inconsistent. The point of view of the director is unclear until the ending. And even then, one wonders about the final lines, which might contradict what has gone before. The best clues to the intent of director Bong Joon Ho are his earlier films, like ""Snowpiercer"" or ""Host"", which feel less ambiguous."

I had expected 'Once upon a time in Hollywood' ,'The Irishman' or 'Joker' to win best picture or maybe 'Marriage Story' as the outsider. When 'Parasite' won, it was a shock, but I was glad that a foreign film had won an Oscar even though I had not seen the film. It had to be a great piece to get an Oscar, so I was keen to see it. I saw the film yesterday and have to admit that it was a good film, however I don't believe that it should have been an Oscar winner against the others, it certainly was not a better film than any of the others I have mentioned. The first half was good, a good black comedic story about envy, scams, can't say any more without spoilers. The second half it drifted into being really silly and became a farce as the script became more and more unbelievable. It is a film that has to be seen, so it is worth the price of a ticket. Maybe I was expecting too much of it! I am giving it a 7/10, but it could have been a 10/10 had they kept it real."

Probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films. The acting was fine. It's the story itself that left a lot to be desired. I really had high hopes going into this one.

This is an enormously evocative film which creates (and leaves behind) various moods and atmospheres on its way through the inventive, but nevertheless fairly predictable plot which twists and turns in somewhat gimmickry ways. Watching Parasite for the first time is like watching a really clever movie for the second time: you know what will unfold, but you're still quite amazed by the audacity and skill of the presentation. Whether or not you enjoy Parasite on a meta-level, however, will arguably depend on to what degree you make any use of Bong Joon-ho's dab at East-Asian social classes anno 2019. These are not arguments that present themselves logically; they are offered through the absurd behaviour of the movie's two conflicting families - none of whom are sympathetic, even though Mr. Bong ultimately asks us insistently to care for them."

As a Japanese person, I've always had a special connection to Asian cinema, even if I haven't always been a fan of the style. My interest in Korean and Japanese movies is often driven by nostalgia rather than a refined taste for the acting and directing styles. It's not that these movies are bad, it's just that my preferences lean elsewhere. However, there are exceptions. One Korean movie that truly left a mark on me is Oldboy. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to skip the Hollywood remake and dive straight into the original. This movie is a visceral experience that will leave you reeling. The same feeling applies to Parasite. Again, I need to become more familiar with the director and actors. I went to the theater to watch this mainly because of the many praises, awards, and the surprising Oscar nomination for both the Best International Movie and Best Movie categories. Of course, I had to check it out. When I first sat down to watch Parasite, I had no idea what to expect. The movie starts off like a slice-of-life soap opera, a slow burner that gradually builds tension. But as the story unfolds, the tension escalates, leading to a gripping climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I can't speak too much, not to spoil the surprises and twists. And, oh boy, there are many twists to this plot. It's best to avoid reading anything about the story so you are surprised. Overall, the directing is superb. The screenplay is not complicated, and it's very well written. The acting is also competent, mixing moments of comedy and tension very well. But, it feels ""dry,"" if it makes any sense. This is definitely only a movie for some. And as I have minimal exposition to Korean filmmaking, I don't have many other references than Oldboy (and the rest of the Vengeance Trilogy movies, which I'm not too fond of so much). But Oldboy has such a visceral punch that it's hard to forget, even years after I watched it. Parasite lacks this punch even though the kind of storytelling is similar in a way: a tragedy. Don't get me wrong; it's a very good movie to go see in the theaters. But IMHO, I don't know why this movie is Oscar material. Alas, yes, there are several other nominees, but I also don't understand why they are Oscar material. From another perspective, for most of the movie, it reminded me of a Tarantino movie. Again, it still needs the punch. But it's textbook Tarantino through and through."

I think it's definitely a good movie in fact one of the memorable ones of 2019, but i still feel the praise this is garnering is slightly overrated for what it offers. The concept is nice. I don't know how the dialogues are in Korean but the English subtitle translation was average and didn't have the comic nature many times. The build up was slow but the movie picks up pace pretty quickly after that. After some shenanigans by the family, the real chaos which is at the heart of the story starts. The frantic events at the end didn't make a lot of sense. I think the end kind of soured overall impression of movie for me, for the sake of keeping review spoiler free I would not say which event exactly but you'd know when you watch it. Another problem I found was that movie tried to be a lot than what story could have allowed it to be. Comedy thriller would be perfect description but then there are attempts at being a drama movie too and they feel less coherent to the movie... The acting was good by almost every character for the most part. Overall I would say it was a good watch and it is memorable for the uniqueness of the story."

I can see that PARASITE is highly original and filled with ironical social commentary, but Best Picture? Nah. It's hard to write about it without spoilers, but it's a tale of two Korean families, one rich and living in a hilltop mansion, the other struggling in a grimy basement below the bottom of the same hill. Crafty as well as envious, the poor people slowly (a bit too slowly, IMO) infiltrate the lives of the rich folk. When the plutocrats take off for a camping trip, things start to unravel. The theme of the working class subverting the Upper Crust was brilliantly explored in Joseph Losey's THE SERVANT (1963), which did not morph from Social Drama into Horror territory. I think PARASITE has to be judged as a horror movie, since that's where it ends up. Set against the standards of Class-A horrors like PSYCHO and THE EXORCIST, I would not put PARASITE in their league. Good, yes, and clever, beautifully shot and edited (and acted), but not up there with The Best. Sorry!"

Our society is not equal and it can never be. That's the fact and we have to live with it. Just imagine a predator and a prey playing equal in mother nature. Chaotic, right? Very well cinematographed, written, directed and acted but it was just unbelievable to always see rich guys play dumb and easily gullible. They are not like that.

The problem with the movie, is that it drags in the first 30 minutes, the screentime should be cut to 1h30, 2 hours and 10 minutes is too long... The Dark Humour presented here is really good, and the Climax of the movie, starting with the Flood is also Great. But some of the dialogues in the movie are lacking. The directors work here is really good no doubt, but this movie is after all a Independant Movie with a short budget, with few sets, and some good Twists and Turns in the story... The actors, like almost every Korean movie i've seen, seem authentic and act like real people so they do a very good job. This Movie is a Good One, almost an 8 but the ending could have been better.

The story is good but the execution is far from great. The characters are not developed enough for you to sympathize with any of them. For example you have no context and never get to know the personality of the son in the poor family which is just one of the main characters. The acting is exaggerated and shallow and leaves you wondering if it's supposed to be a comedy but then it doesn't get to be funny. On the other hand many reviews say it's a thriller, but it never made me care what happens if they are caught. Some parts are also very implausible, for example in the final scenes, where people randomly live / die independently of the severity of the injuries. Then there's the social inequality theme. Low income people are portrayed as the scammers, so I wasn't able to sympathize with them. Couldn't rate it higher than 7."

There is little doubt that as a loser family start to target a rich household, their early success cannot hold. I'm a fan of Korean films anyway, and so was relaxed about the various styles this film goes through. While the film is totally accessible, there are still enough references to Korean and Asian society to make it a little demanding on the viewer - which is why the Oscar success was nicely surprising. The film does not perfectly handle it's different layers - the political message and the moral message rather wrap around each other awkwardly. The pacing doesn't always work either - the direction is relaxed in the house but pokes around nervously outdoors. This is not the best Korean film I've seen - Old Boy and I saw the Devil were superior - but the setup, cinematography and the sheer chutzpah of the plotting make it a sharp witted success. (I don't reference the classic Old Boy accidentally; that too was effectively a double layered film, and on reflection it was a little better at it.)"

This is a 8.5 rating, just like Whiplash, a movie far greater than this one. Maybe it just doesnt fit my taste, but as i am seeing trough this section, i am not the only one with the same opinion."

The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they con their way into working for the wealthy Park family, leading to unexpected and shocking consequences. The film's greatest strength lies in its storytelling. Bong Joon-ho skillfully balances humor and tension, keeping the audience engaged and on edge throughout. The screenplay is sharp and layered, offering biting commentary on class disparity and social inequality without being preachy. The performances are stellar across the board. Song Kang-ho, as the Kim family patriarch, delivers a nuanced performance, while the rest of the cast, including Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam, bring depth and authenticity to their roles. Visually, ""Parasite"" is stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in its production design. The contrast between the Kims' cramped basement home and the Parks' luxurious mansion is striking and symbolic. However, some viewers might find the film's tonal shifts jarring, and its ending, while impactful, may not satisfy everyone. Despite these minor issues, ""Parasite"" is a thought-provoking and well-crafted film that leaves a lasting impression. It's a unique cinematic experience that challenges and entertains in equal measure."

That being said I don't rate it as highly as most critics. The characters where my favourite aspect as there was almost no (if any) characters I thought where out of place and/or didn't fit. The story and world that was created for the movie was absolutely fine and isn't like any other movie I have seen before it. I liked the premise, it had me interested and semi-hooked straight away. Although it's definitely not handled perfectly. That brings us to the ending. The ending was by far (for me) the worst part of the movie. The last maybe 15-20 minutes where a disaster knocking the movie down from a 8/10 to a 7/10. Also the former maids character and the stuff around her (which I won't get into for spoiler reasons) I though took away but just not as much as that ending. I did however love how they showed the poor family and although not as much I also like how the rich family where represented. Although I'm not sure how accurate to reality it is (which I assume it is accurate). I believe it at the very least did the job you would need for a movie of this elk. Great work in this department. Cast - 9.5/10 Story - 7/10 Action (although not very important) - 3.5/10 The World - 8/10 Overall a very good watch but not as impressive as people give it credit for in my eyes. Solid Movie - 7/10."

However, I feel like all the people who praised it as an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of all times must have been watched ""Transformers"" and ""Avengers"" all their life. The film itself is solid in most aspects, but conceptually I don't buy the cheap social critique and easy populism that one more time depicts the rich as spoiled, dumb, and not worthy of their wealth. Perfect food for the envious middle-class that dreams of living in big houses, driving expensive cars. Retrospectively, the last season has been full of this kind of ""us vs. Them"" films, and while ""Parasite"" might actually be the only one to be any good, it's not thanks to its message. Actually, it would have been alright if the movie ended with the party scene without all that subsequent melodramatic crap to glorify the working class who ""lost"" gain. Up to that point, both families are almost equally ambiguous, with even some interesting reflections on how this generation's weak spot for resonant brand names and exclusivity, as even the humblest servant now is supposed to have a resume full of renowned names or belong to elite companies to get a job. The vertical depiction of society is also effective in its simplicity, with the Parks' physically living above everything else, but at the same time unable to see what lies beneath due to the high walls and trees that entirely cover the view from their garden. The layout of their house also mirrors this verticality with rooms and hallways they are not even aware of. An above-average film overall but definitely no masterpiece, not even Boon Joon-ho's best."

The acting is first rate. The cinematography is state of the art. Beautifully filmed! The ending is very challenging because the viewer likely finds the Kim family very charming. As the charming underdogs, they are easy to like. As they suffer from terrible poverty and misfortune, they are easy to gain sympathy. The viewer will make excuses for their many lapses of character. But here is the point: they are evil people. Do not look at their intentions, but look at their actions. Look at the choices that they make. They are foul-mouthed criminals. They are consumed by envy. They have no moral restraints. The many victims of the evil Kim family are not portrayed as especially admirable people, so it can be easy to overlook the morality play that is being portrayed. It's okay for them to suffer because the audience is sympathizing with the Kims. Besides, the crimes against them are portrayed comedically. The audience laughs with the Kims as they commit their crimes. Until the full measure of the tragedy unfolds. What appeared to be a comedy, is revealed to be an awful tragedy. The trap has been sprung and the viewer has been judged with the guilty. It's a great work of art. Unpleasant, but thought-provoking."

This started out a black comedy and by the end morphed into something more sinister. We were shown a close knit nuclear family scraping by to survive in a slum-type basement dwelling. They were all universally hard working, inventive and inspired to get on in life, however it was inferred by the script that these attributes were not enough for any social mobility and that any advancement within Korean society was wholly dependent on the possession of family money from the outset. The Director introduced several themes and ideas that he tossed around, never quite landing on any definitive conclusion. We, the viewers were the mouse and the Director the cat. It did strangely have the feel of an Almodovar movie, perhaps this style was an influence. Lastly the obvious intention by the Director to infer wealthy people are parasites due to wealthy inequality was handled badly as it is these very wealthy people that provide currently any wages or opportunity for the poor. The real parasite is the Korean government who collect the taxes and make the laws and have clearly failed to create welfare structures or free education to promote a better society and social mobility. What would happen if all the wealthy people left and there was no tax receipts and communism has certainly not proved the answer. What was good The family bonds were well established, they were all in this together. This very much held the movie together. This was very much a simple linear story and most refreshing in its delivery. There was, for the first two thirds of the movie great dramatic impetus, we were all gripped, and I could certainly feel quite an atmosphere in the picture house. The acting seemed competent from the entire ensemble but it was difficult to judge due to the barrier of the subtitles. The subtitles were nuanced and comprehensive and seemed entirely natural. The cinematography was great and the camera made us feel very much the fly on the wall, and very in keeping with this kind of story. The musical score was great. What was problematic The Director inferred that wealth and opportunity were the way forward and a wholesome aspiration for advancement for the family, but then went onto infer wealth corrupts and perhaps the mere possession of wealth was obscene, this is muddled thinking as it cannot be both as the same time."

The rich live in a big house and enjoy a prosperous life. The poor live in a semi-basement, exuding the smell of poverty.

The film shows an almost epitome of life in a contemporary society in an almost absurd and desperate style. At the bottom, the upper class is a kind of almost Stockholm-like worship, but resent the poor who live better than him. The dream of breaking the class barriers shattered and fell into the abyss of fate, but the son dreamed of buying that house so that one day his father could walk up from the ground and into the sun.

This is probably the reason why I have not been able to truly accept this film, because it is really uncomfortable to think deeper. The structure and technique of the film are shocking, but the idea behind it is really difficult to understand. If you want to say what it makes people think about, it should be the most basic respect between people. No matter what class, status, or situation, you can really treat the other person as a person, not those inferior ones."

This morality play explores that even with a plan man is destined to remain caged and immobile no matter the social and economic aspirations. The story has been told before but Korean director Bong Joon Ho ratches things up a bit, especially in the film's climactic ending. The lower class Kims are masters at manipulation and lying to get ahead and benefit working for a naive wealthy family. Yet sadly the Kim's never advance. The class struggle moves into poor against poor before dissolving into all out chaos between the classes. The director keeps a good distance from the characters painting them in broad strokes. The story ends violently, yet tragically it appears that nothing has really changed. One man confined to hiding in the cellar is simply replaced by another and the futile dream of social and economic advancement continues. I often wondered while watching this film if PARASITE was the correct translation of the title. For me, the class relationships in this film are more symbiotic, each class needing the other to survive. So who or what is the parasite? For the director it is hope: that longing that burrows under the skin that you can't get rid of. This is a well made movie with a thoughtful screenplay that has a natural forward movement to it. There is an artistic, art-house metaphoric quality to it (such as a rock is both a totem and a weapon), but I don't think it is the masterpiece many claim it to be. The movie plays out very straightforward, more like a made for tv mini series. An excellent three-parter perhaps. The production is great and the actors are terrific, parts of it quite funny. However, for me this is a good movie, not a masterpiece nor Oscar best picture worthy. I rate PARASITE 7/10."

But best picture? Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres, which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer. Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for - while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical ""american"" narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status. To its credit, I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non-virtuous and indeed villainous. What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior, while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane. This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect. Now, many are praising the supposedly deep, revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle, but I don't find it nearly as profound as is claimed. The overtly sensational, absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message, and the storyline (even leaving aside the over-the-top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect) is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses, discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction. More importantly, the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one-sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class-determinant normalcy. It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue, even in momentary antithesis. Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one, and also an implausible one because the world is not so one-sided and simple. For this reason, the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics. It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation, but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise."

The initial plot twists and turns are deftly handled by director Bong Joon-ho, there are some superbly executed scenes of tension, the performances are great, the cinematography is lovely, and the film's social commentary on how different classes view and treat each other allows for plenty of delicious satire, but the second half of the film still feels frustratingly restrained in terms of sheer audacity.

Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact. The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop. On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence."

Yes, it is good piece of cinematography. Telling story of different worlds people live in. Separate social bubbles. But what afterthoughts do we have while leaving the cinema? ""The rich get richer and the poor get poorer""? Obvious truths. Nothing new we didn't knew about. Sterile environment of upper class, cockroach life of underprivileged. Dullness of these which have and hopelessness of these which don't. Characters without depth put into roles they were born into. Some symbolism justifying incostinant and improbable plot, but is there enough reason for its application? I see very little."

Also interesting insight into Korean culture and behavior. The only thing that makes this movie bad is that it is too negative, and especially negative ending. Teaches us about instability of life, greed, desperation, survival, crime. Worth an oscar at least because of its depth or because of seriousness of topics or lessons. Not good to watch for those sensitive to scary and difficult realistic situations like getting hurt, imprisoned, etc."

I however don't think there's some conspiracy by the Academy Awards or other American institutions to put international movies above American ones for some sort of ""social justice"", and I'm perfectly OK with them choosing an international movie if they just think it was the best movie of the year. There's been a few years in my time where I thought a non-American movie was better than the American-made ones that year. I was initially excited to see the movie, especially after hearing some hints of what it was about, and that it was a dark and stunning psychological take on people of different classes. I think class disparity is a huge problem in our country, so it felt very relevant. I also love dark psychological movies, but unfortunately after seeing this, I realized it wasn't that dark and wasn't that psychological. While it explores class disparity, neglect, and cruelty, there's so many problems with both the protagonists (if you can call them that) and antagonists (if that's really what they were). The movie's biggest flaws are mostly in presentation, but some of the situations and actions of the characters are preposterous and feel very contrived. It's a riveting watch, is fairly well acted and directed, memorable, and has interesting situations, but too many times I had to suspend disbelief to an almost comical degree. The movie does have dark humor, which I appreciated, but I think some of it is unintended. This reminded me of Snowpiercer, as that had so many preposterous situations that I couldn't help but laugh. I think this is almost a signature of Bong Joon-ho, which worked well in The Host, but not so much in these other two movies. I haven't seen Mother, so I'm not sure if it's truly a common or intentional thread in his movies. I've enjoyed a lot of Korean movies, but I think Joon-ho may be overrated at this point. I also think some of the violence is unnecessary and for shock value, and gets a bit overly-explicit, and some character's reaction to it is a bit odd and from my perspective a bit unbelievable and sometimes comes off as contrived."

Actually not just a bit of luck; they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because that's what happened with Parasite. It is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought ""That's a lot better than what I expected!"". Domino effect followed and today, we got this movie that's overrated and predictable. No different than your average ""ThRiLLeR"" movie. P.

Is it accessible to western audiences? Absolutely, but we'll never know if we missed anything from the original korean. But ultimatey it's a very light hearted comedy for 1h52 hours, followed by comedy horror for 5 minutes, and drama for 10. Expecting a deep social commentary from SK is like expecting a critique of the CCP coming out of China. At no point is the 'system' that created the situation depicted criticised in any meaningful manner. There was far more depth in 'the platform'. Enjoyed the goofy, light hearted laughs, the heartwarming , well depicted family interactions, and the dramatic bittersweet ending. 6/10"

""Snowpiercer"" was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films, which turned out to be every bit as great as Snowpiercer was. I'm a huge fan of his, and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d'Or win. He's a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it, and I'd say winning that award had been a long time coming for him. However, after my boundless anticipation for this film, and finally getting the chance to actually watch it, I was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment. I've read many reviews of this film, all of them flooded with unworthy praise. Many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade, filled with ""metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout."" Others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns, and unfolds in ""satisfying, unexpected ways,"" leaving the viewer wondering what's gonna happen next. The former sentiment's mention of ""metaphors and allegories,"" and the way they are presented in this film, have been done countless times over the course of mankind's brief existence, and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before Marx introduced his theory, yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive. There's only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a ""twist"" in the film, which ultimately wasn't that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling. Besides that moment, everything is utterly predictable. I don't understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before. Seemingly every Hollywood blockbuster thriller presents a concept not that dissimilar from the concepts utilized by Bong Joon-Ho for this film. Additionally, ""Parasite"" suffers from glaring screenwriting issues, the most blatant one being an over-reliance on convenient narrative tools to artificially move the story forward, rather than letting it flow naturally. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but as an example, there's a certain set of stairs in the film that acts as the focal point for the story's progression."

This is even more obvious when you consider that his other notable film is basically about the same thing. Rich vs poor. This is a bit odd considering he has a net worth of 30 million dollars. This movie is about a poor family that lies and weasels their way into the service of a rich family. In doing so they not only screw over several people but also murder a few of them in the process. And yet at the end of the film we're supposed to feel that all of this is somehow justified. Or maybe we're not supposed to feel that it's justified because I sure didn't. Not really sure why it got so much praise. Could be because we are living in a time when the majority of movies being made are superheros or reboots. Thats basically the only thing this movie has going for it. It was entertaining and well made but I didn't like the ending at all.

Yes. Oscar worthy? Nope.,2020-02-13,imdb,"As I watched the Academy Awards gala and wondered who and what would win in each category I never in my wildest dreams thought of or considered Parasite. But that is just because I hadn´t seen it beforehand and didn´t know if it was that good as they say. But I guess I didn´t consider it to win anything much, because in my opinion there were so many wonderful movies represented this year and especially for the Oscar for best movie. There were so many gems and yes, I had my favourites that I was rooting for. I was extremely disappointed when I found out that Parasite won best picture. And then I felt bad and thought to myself well it is not right for me to judge this movie without even seeing it, maybe it is genius and excellent and so much more than the Joker or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. So yesterday I finally got around to watching the much praised Oscar-winning Parasite. The first half of the movie was abysmal for me. Maybe because I just didn´t quite understand how to feel about it, how to relate to it and was trying to think where would the story go. There were some good moments and I liked the camera work, the angles and a few comical incidents. But mostly I couldn´t wait for it to get to the point. I know some people said exactly the same about Once Upon a Time in Hollywood as well, that it was boring during the first half. But in that I don´t agree, I was fully enjoying the director´s vision in that, the actors, the dialogues, everything. But in Parasite I couldn´t really find those things to enjoy. I am not saying the acting was bad, but I also cannot say it was excellent in some way. The second half got interesting for me. I liked the way the story progressed, how things started happening, how people showed their true colors and how human nature is sometimes just awful. And there were a fair amount of suspenseful moments where I actually held my breath a bit and wanted to find out how the scene is going to play out. So, this is all good, this is what a movie is supposed to do - entertain you. The ending - in my opinion it was good (not mind-blowingly excellent) and morbid (also not a bad thing, but makes you think and analyze). So all-in-all it is hard to even give it a score that I am sure of. At first I thought I will give it a 7, because as I said, at least half the time I was interested and invested on the storyline. But I guess I am a bit biased since I am still a bit shocked about the whole Oscar thing and it irritates me a bit."

Some humor is sprinkled in as Ki-woo (Choi Woo-Shik) scans the ceiling and windows for some unprotected (or underprotected) wi-fi to steal as the unemployed family can't afford phone service and they need it to find work. Their partially underground dwelling is susceptible to various indignities from drunken pee and bug killing gasses to flood. When they do get a gig assembling pizza boxes, they can't seem to get it right for some reason. Their luck changes when Ki-woo's friend Min (Seo-joon Park) passes his tutoring job on to him. I little fib and a lot of confidence, and the money starts flowing in to the Kim family. But then he sees an in for his sister Ki-jung (So-dam Park). I suppose simply introducing her as his sister who is legitimately good at art might not have worked, so they go for a much bigger lie and paycheck. Greed is kicking in with head spinning intensity. Before long the family is doing things so atrocious, I started borderline hating the film. Because its protagonists are so unjustifiably vile. To be sure, I loved the parasite allegory. One gets in, starts multiplying, eventually severely damaging or destroying the host. That last part I was dreading the most. Yes, I was also dreading what will happen once the scam is discovered. But I felt really bad for the mother (Yeo-jeong Cho) who inadvertently brought the infestation into her home. She was just trying to do what any mother would - what's best for her kids. Her only fault - she wasn't too bright. Of course, I could have never anticipated the crazy plot twist that unraveled it all. But as the story rolled towards the end in a gut wrenching tangle of victims and perpetrators, the ""host"" family was treated as if their suffering were at best unimportant, at worst - funny. And they are the ones who did nothing wrong. Except for being rich - I suppose that automatically makes them villains. It was really bothering me. But that wasn't the only problem I had with the film. It didn't make sense to me how the Kims could come up with and perfectly execute an elaborate scheme, when they couldn't even assemble pizza boxes right. And if they are this smart, how is it possible that even the two young ones can't get work? Is Korean economy that bad? Another problem was that interesting things were introduced, but dropped without explanation. Like we never found out why the old housekeeper looked like she had been mugged. Or what Ki-woo was planning to do with the lucky stone."

To give a movie an Academy Award for best picture and best director without nominating any of its actors is indicative of the fact that while the film's screenplay is definitely intriguing, character development is sorely lacking, along with any kind of memorable performances. Did the director direct a gang of ghosts? The message of the film is politically correct, and although I agree with it, I see this as just another ""Green Book"" cop out. I'm also appalled that the movie glorifies violence as a solution to economic disparity, a disparity that is directly attributable to governments and not as individualistically motivated as this movie so strongly suggests.

I just dread hearing people talking about this and saying ""OMG DID U EVER TRY WATCHING KOREAN MOVIES BEFORE???"" It's sure happened to me. I hope it dies down. All in all, it's a decent, well-placed movie with masterful use of tone, but Cannes and the Oscars and all the people on this very site raving could do so much better. I just hope the movie will be a gateway for people rather than being that movie that lets you say ""Hey, I've seen FOREIGN films before!"""
imdb2389,movie covers variety genres social issues rapidly developing countries south korea facing sudden unequal distribution wealth inequality classes revolves family grifters feel power exact revenge wealthy class family film drag boring viewer loses story told shorter time tend lengths people feel underdog capable extract revenge,6,Interesting but certainly not spectacular!,2020-03-01,imdb,"The movie covers a variety of genres and social issues that rapidly developing countries like South Korea are facing, a sudden but unequal distribution of wealth, and inequality between classes. It revolves around a family of Grifters who feel they must take back power and exact revenge on a wealthy class family. The problem with the film is that it tends to drag out and become boring after a while. The viewer loses interest. The story could have been told in a much shorter time. It does tend to show what lengths people will go to if they feel they are the underdog, and what they are capable of doing to extract revenge."

I get that most that hate it maybe didn't understand the message - I did, but it was written in a mind-boggling illogical plot-hole ridden way. What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank. Clearly over-hyped and not worth anything more than my 6/10"

This lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon. 4. I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately."

The almost two hour long run time made it feel drawn out especially for nothing super intriguing taking place. There were definitely solid moments throughout, good acting and a general level of engagement, it just didn't super draw me in. I think if I had watched this without being privy to any of the hype I might have liked it more, but I guess I was just slightly disappointed.

It does not measure up to films like A Separation, Life is beautiful, The Postman, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and many others films that deserved an Oscar for best picture. There are many other things this film is not. It is more a tragic horror movie and a deliberative reflection on class society than a comedy. There are no laughing moments in this film unless you have an extremely dark sense of humor. The acting is very uneven, sometimes brilliant and sometimes amateurish, and the script, even though it is certainly original and in many aspects wellwritten, has several obvious plotholes."

It has the same problem the director's previous ""The Host"" had: the pacing is broken. That's not all, though. People have written about the movie's unexpected twists and turns. The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere. The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand? But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention. Pity. Some of the sequences were brilliant."

I bet you most people can't objectively agree on why they like this movie. Perhaps, it is truly a masterpiece for the sophisticated movie goers and other people who understand the themes of the movie well but these are like 20% of those calling it a masterpiece.. For the ordinary person, it is just very average movie that if you saw without knowing it was PARASITE *cue the applause the trails*. I did not feel anything for the poor people. Blame capitalism all you want but, they didn't have to go that far. You argue it's greed but they are supposedly smart or street smart but through out the movie. They make very foolish decisions which ultimately ends in this end which is a tragedy for the rich. I mean, if it's a poor people vs rich, then obviously their family would have the other poor family. You add greed? All in all. I'm tired now. Enjoy being pretentious"

I ended up disappointed. The first hour is absolutely cracking and whilst the plot is very predictable it plays out beautifully with some good comedic lines. The movie then dries up a little and it feels like it's lost its mojo before it then goes BANG! Bang good or bang bad will be up to the individual as to how much escapism you can tolerate and how many holes you are willing to gloss over. For me it was bang bad however I have also watched the Irishman recently so compared to that crock this is like a masterpiece! Was it worth a watch? Yes. Would I pay at the cinema again? Definitely not! The moral of the story is that in Hollywood we cannot trust!

The thrill is cheap. The cinematography is average. Too much implausibility. ""Marriage Story"" is even more entertaining that this movie."

It's all public. In the most cases meta's score given to a movie shows a better rating, a more realistic one compared to imdb. I've seen 1917, I was sick of that people don't even know what cinematography is. The whole movie was made like ""Rope"" except that Rope had an amazingly interesting story. 1917 had nothing in it. Paths of Glory was in many terms a lot more realistic. Long story short, I didn't like 1917 at all. I had no idea why it was even nominated. Then I saw the Marriage Story. As soon as I realised Adam Driver is in it (Star Wars guy), I just wanted to not like the movie because I don't like the new SW movies at all. Then it turned out it was amazing. He was very good, the movie was very good. I liked The Irishman too but the Marriage Story was superior. Then came the awards and Parasite won. I saw it has a score of 8.6 and I know the director. He did a crime movie which I liked (Memories of a Murder). That one was very good. So I just watched Parasite too. It was interesting, but maybe I've seen too many actually good movies, so I do not blow my mind just like that. The characters were ok and maybe that's all. The story was just interesting. There was nothing special about it. It was an original story, but it won't make it good. It has nothing to tell us. It's pretty much like a half written mess. If somebody works for me for years, I won't fire him/her just because a tale someone told me. I would atleast question the worker. Atleast! At this point the movie was very unrealistic. The smell factor. We can't smell it :) But all that food as whiskey on that table has a strong smell. You can clearly see under the table. I just had no idea how is that realistic.. They were all given good wages and still they didn't take a shower or anything like that. They did all smell bad.. Sooo unrealistic and because of it the father's motivation made absolute no sense. No sense at all. Especially in that situation. It felt like they had to end the story somehow and they chose this way for some reason. Other factors of the movie are no special neither. Roma stands on 7.7 and is by far better in every aspect. Currently I've rated over 2500 movies, I write scripts, I'm working on to direct one of my works myself and I have to tell you that this movie was just OK and I have really no idea why would anyone give it a score of 8 or higher. If I would write and direct a movie like this, I would be not satisfied. Not at all. For me it was 6.5 as it was interesting."

Is it thriller? Comedy? Drama? Societal critique? It's all of it; and therefore none of it. All in all, I was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated. The style is there, I grant it. Cinematography is great. Acting is awkward at some points, but it's OK because of the partially comedy-like nature of this film. But then, there is a problem with story telling. It builds up nicely toward the middle, where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below. And then it makes an unexpected turn. It's alright to make a surprise at the end (I'd even say it's good), as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line. A reveal must make sense once it is revealed. This one didn't do the job convincingly for me. We are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party. This film is just fine, but no masterpiece in my opinion. Some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting; others are so obscure to the point of being pointless. Great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum. Unfortunately, this one is leaning to the pointlessness."

First the good bits, the rare mix of various genres into one movie is something that might keep you on the edge of your seat or overburden your cognitive ability. All the actors have delivered a good performance and cinematography is good too. Some scenes depicting abject urban poverty are really riveting. But if the writer or director wanted to deliver a message about poverty, they have further muddied the waters by expressing this as poverty. A few healthy adults, who had no unforeseen shocks to their ability to work hard and earn a decent living, go on to do things which range from boundaryline unethical to pure heinous crimes. A long drawn second half makes it boring. One of the reviews I watched about this film says ""A good movie is the one where you can't tell who is the villain"". Well you will be able to tell all the villains by the time the movie ends, and you guessed it right, its definitely not ""poverty"". This movie definitely did not deserve the Oscars over 1917 and Joker. period."

I think this is GOOD film making, but not the best movie of the year. I've heard others call this a movie about class structure. Yes, but in true Hollywood fashion, the rich people are generous and trusting if a little naive.

Unsure how this won an Oscar and has such a high rating. Thought the same with Spirited Away, appears that these movies won Oscars for being different to the Hollywood norm, I think so anyway. It was a fun watch, but not the best of movies like others would suggest. If you have seen many Korean movies before, you will understand that they don't follow the typical Hollywood formula. Watching this is nothing new and there are far better examples of amazing Korean movies. Overall, this is worth a watch for sure, but it isn't the best of any genre IMHO."

I went into it not knowing what to expect at all, which is how I'd recommend others watch it as well. I would rate the movie an 8, but I find it hard to justify why. If I imagine the exact same story being played out in an American setting, it would get a 4 from me at most. So I settled on a 6... The storyline is absolutely rediculous, but you can't help but to keep watching. Interestingly, the movie doesn't convince you to root for the main characters. That might be it's biggest strength. This movie is definitely worth the watch, if only so that you can form your own opinion."

But those novels missed something really important, that gets lost in all the circlejerking about the symbolism and little details - whether or not its actually interesting to read. Whether it provides a good story, good dialogue, good characters. Similarly, Parasite is a movie rich in themes and symbolism. What I particularly liked is the mature exploration of class dynamics. Its the obvious central theme of the film and its done very well. I dont think anything in Hollywood could ever manage to explore this theme with such nuance and maturity. This movie is also a really good work of art. The direction is top quality, and it effortlessly goes from comedy, to family drama, to horror, to thriller, and then finally ends in a Tarantino-esque finale. But the actual plot of the film? The dialogues, the drama, its all mediocre at best. What really happens in this film. What makes a viewer curious, interested, surprised? How do the characters develop, how does the plot develop, where and when is there interesting dialogue that pulls you in? In my opinion, the overarching script of this movie is not particularly strong when you evaluate it in terms of core storytelling. And worse, it doesn't use its runtime well in order to tell whatever it wants to tell. And while a film critic might be impressed by its symbolism and the way it shifts in tone and genres, I think it actually detracts from the viewer experience if the primary aim of the viewer is to see an enjoyable movie. I'm far from someone who merely enjoys popcorn fiction. There's a reason I hate Marvel movies. But I also think that a movie has to strike a balance, I don't think Parasite did that. I think it has benefited from collective overhyping that is partially a result of the heaps of praise by critics and partially because it is a decent movie released in a time of popcorn movie trash."

After all, it scored only 1/10th of a point lower than ""Lord of the Rings"" (first one) so it must be a pretty damn AWESOME movie, right? Well....NO! It wasnt a BAD movie, it just wasnt....magical. Now, I do love my Sci Fi and Fantasy movies, however movies based on real life can be magical as well. Think ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Se7en"". This movie has a decent concept based on the interactions of 2 classes of people. I would go so far as to say there is no clear ""good guy"" and no clear ""bad guy."" In life, there seldom is. That said, it was interesting and entertaining but no way it ranks a 8.6. I think results are being skewed by a foreign market that has (understandable) pride in making a film with international appeal."

It's clearly that it took lots of brains and talent to produce such a tape. It even has a message and on realities of society and a study on social classes in Korea. It addresses the issue of attitudes and the way we look at life, be it positive or negative, it has a huge impact. In addition, in general i love Asian Cinema, especially Chinese and Korean films. BUT saddly, this not for me. I did not like it. Did not enjoy it. Once I hit the 90 minute mark i was just about to give up. Still i stayed till the end because of the amazingly great reviews. Korean movies are just fantastic, and this might not be the exception. I have seen many online and in cinemas. they are AWESOME. Parasite to me was annoying, depressing, negative.... a total tale of betrayal... Parasite tries to teach that you must never open the doors of your house nor your trust to others... or at least be super careful..?? could be. You can watch the movie and make up your mind. You might be among the 99.99% of people who loves it. I am in the 0.01 % who do not :) (my humble opinion)"

There had to be a ""counter-balace"" and this movie got hyped. The first half is overly melodramatic and ""funny"" as in American Pie type funny, and the latter half at the very best portrays some of the struggles of Korean society-presented in a weird and almost Twilight Zone-ish way. But that's litetally it! Besides the sudden plot/atmospheric twist there is little else. Imagine if K-pop was a movie, and the last part of the tune turns to a Metallica song. That's this movie in a nutshell. It was not bad, but all the stellar reviews are give it way too much credit. Joker won, the rest is just attempts to br de jour."

As far as Korean masterpieces go I thought ""The Handmaiden"" and ""The Housemaid"" were far better stories about class. The script had tremendous ideas and I was looking forward to them ... and then they just dropped off and switched to a new plot. It felt very messy. There were scenes that had no follow up or no point. Like they had to fill a plot hole last minute. If hours of this film were cut, that would make sense. It felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a dark drama, or a dark comedy. If it wanted to be just a family friendly dark comedy, you went too far, if you wanted to be a intense drama, you really dropped the ball. It felt like the director wanted to appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe. The more I think about it, the less respect I seem to have for its ""artistic"" merrit. Absolutely Overrated. As I'm reading throught the miles of reviews, I'm convinced these are westerners who just started watching foreign films this year, or they're all paid. The common theme is people seem to think they are incredibly intelligent for having watched this. Another reviewer commented this is the SAME exact plot as ""Married with Children"" even down to Chicago, Illinois being a factor. Just blew my mind and now I have even less respect for the script."

But, to be totally honest, as a lover of Asian cinema, not that different. For example Thirst by Park Chan-Wook is off the charts different. But, an ok, if somewhat erratic, sloppy dark comedy nonetheless. Full of unexpected twists and turns. Some plot points go nowhere unfortunately. Quite a bit of focus at one point in the movie is on the fact that the previous housekeeper's face has been beaten. In fact, the question is specifically raised as to what happened and yet.... never answered. WTF? A quirky look at the class divide. I found the wrap up at the end a little long and unnecessary, and honestly found some of the final scenes discordant. Switching to a narrated jumpy set of scenes with a dream scene thrown in for good measure. It all seened very amateurish. Which is sad because the first 3 quarters were great. The individual buttons for the individual stair pendant lights? Really? A ridiculous prop to build in the morse code prop which, in itself, was trivial and silly. Also the master architect designed his escape bunker to resemble a horror set with no egress to the outside world? Very very incongruous and illogical. Oscar worthy? I definitely don't agree, but there you go. An amusing non Hollywood movie but so so when compared to its Asian peers. A great opportunity for the less educated Hollywood elite to show how politically woke they are. 🙄"

I guess when the USA is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as Harvey Weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old USA social justice upheavel the Academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the Best Picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive, so why not send some awards to South Korea? We heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about Parasite, and I would agree that the first half was decent enough, but the latter half I felt I was watching a cheap version of a Bruce Lee action film. I really enjoyed the cinematography, and the set designs were eloquent, but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled, sort of like when in the 1939 Wizard Of Oz, the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her. I cannot honestly say this was a memorable film, certainly not Academy Award Best Picture worthy, and I would not recommend this film as a ""must see"" such as the 2019 One Upon a Time In Hollywood is a must see at least three times. I give Parasite a decent but no higher IMDB rating then 6 out of 10."

Well directed, interesting story (even if there were some clunky moments), good acting, good dialogue but way too long. People are raving about PARASITE. I'm not one of them. Masterpiece? Hardly. All the characters are supremely unlikable. Perhaps that was intentional. Ironically, the rich family provoked more sympathy which I doubt WAS intentional. I racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie. Do you suppose bc it has a sub text? I mean, of course it has a sub text. it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in Korea. But that is plainly obvious. It's not subtle. Actually it's not even a sub text, it IS the text. But up against Hollywood cinema which rarely has ANY sub text and usually just presents us with a story on the screen writ large PARASITE then is seen as sophisticated. I didn't rate PARASITE very highly. That's my loss I guess."

I've read at least 20 of them, and many are engaging and brilliant. But I'm going to do something different. I'll speak to the Tarantinoesque nature of this film. There's a program on AXS-TV called ""The Big Interview."" Dan Rather spends an hour talking with noted personalities across all genres of pop culture. Several years ago he sat down with Quentin Tarantino (QT) and conducted a wonderful interview. I don't want to include spoilers here so I think that if you're a QT fan you will understand what Dan is referencing, below. Late into the interview, without accusing him of being exploitive, Dan asks QT to discuss this: How does he have the audience laugh and cry all in the same film? How does he get an audience to view scenes of a horrific nature yet laugh during the movie or come out of the theater smiling? QT's response: ""when a movie really, really does it to me, it's because it's made me feel very different emotions...I'm the kind of director that I want to play you, as an audience. I want to be the conductor and you're my orchestra. And (I conduct) the sounds that I make you to make, and the feelings that I get you to feel... And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings, and I give you something ELSE to feel. And then I STOP you from feeling those feelings and make you feel something ELSE yet again. Well, if a director can do that, if a director can pull that off...then you're a lucky audience member because you really had an experience that night. You went to the MOVIES; that was worth leaving the house. I can't help but make my stuff funny because I think of things in a humorous way...but it's not all a big joke. I do like the idea that I can do this to the audience: Laugh. Laugh. Laugh. Stop laughing. Stop laughing. (snaps fingers) Laugh. And maybe that stop laughing is something horrific...(maybe it's) hard to watch."" He then cites specific examples from one of his movies where he said he needed to traumatize the audience. I love a lot of what QT has done, but not all of it. This movie seems to follow the QT blueprint but then it veers off in one direction and stays there. I did not leave the theater smiling. Thus, my rating."

Please! It was interesting though...,2020-02-24,imdb,"I'll try and keep this shortish. For reference I think there are at least 3 films of 2019 that were better than parasite including 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood', 'The Irishman', and 'The Joker'. If you're not the kind to often seek out great original content than I can imagine why you might think this movie is really some kind of unique, fresh gem. But there are too many plot conveniences and unrealistic character behaviors to really class this as ""The greatest film of the decade"". Not by a mile. Having said that I found the movie had several interesting threads and themes going on, some of which resolved, and some which were probably the most interesting went nowhere. ie the young 'rich' kids role, among other things. That was slightly disappointing. I think the so called 'class divide' commentary was there, but not to the extent that everyone raves. It showed more that there is not such a simple black and white difference between the two, which I appreciate. But I think the 'class divide' actually provided more a part of the organic scenery than a driving force of the film. Overall, I'm glad I saw it, but I would have rather just watched it at home, than paid to see it in gold class. Does that make me a bad person!?"

Brilliant social commentary with a masterful ability to finesse. As far as ""Parasite"", like I said, it was just good.

Each scene had a exact idea of what to cover and how to do it. It went superb with the plot that by all standards was very very slow and predictable.

More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage. The film was incredibly entertaining too.

It's almost as if there is a genre switch near the end of the film. Where it goes from psychological drama to cartoonish over the top horror.

Good in most respects but mainly it has a catchy hook. An engaging premise. A peculiarity in its treatment of subject and theme. I would not agree that such novelty of idea makes, by itself, for an award winning finished film and certainly in this case I am fairly confident that the film as a whole is much less than the ""vigor"" of its animating conceit; it's 'reason to be' (made). Ancient issues of human inequality of life invested with a catchy and up to date arrangement is a neat idea, hardly groundbreakingly original in world cinema, but it's a neat idea. Essentially a pursuit, in dramatic film, of the degree to which ""upstairs-downstairs"" conditions the life choices, circumstances and outlooks of people caught on opposite sides, how it warps and differentiates lives lived to ultimately decide whole human lives without their own input. This ""have and have nots"" and ""how the other half lives"" drama is not new and indeed it has precursors in western and eastern film and broader fiction. The manner of this drama is in two stages: firstly the ingratiating ""invasion"" of the rich households retinue by the Kim family; eventually completely usurping the established retainers and then secondly the heightening of the old household staff reappearing and ultimately revolting against their disposition; all transpiring almost entirely under the noses, and beneath the awareness of the ""upstairs"" 'haves', the Park family. That's it. That's the best idea. The enervating treatment of an old dramatic theme of rich and poor. It's a good film in its runtime: reasonably written except in certain unbelievable characters and relationships; an insistence on a highly risky full assault on employment opportunities by the Kim family that I baulked at whilst watching; and a missed opportunities to illuminate the 'host' family of 'upstairs': the Parks. The acting was usually reliable although few actors were required to display much range in their performance. A major problem was scenes of drinking, 'drunk' acting was unconvincing. Direction and editing were certain if uninspiring. Technical virtues included a sympathetic use of sound design and a well chosen pallet of colours plus an interesting main location at the Park's house."

For example, fleas live on dogs and consume their blood. According to society, which is constructed in a way that the most educated are burdened with defining the meaning of words, a parasite is a person who consumes resources off of another without returning anything. At least so it says, right? Well, what if an economic recession hits and people lose their jobs and no longer have a way of making the money they need to in order to repay whoever it is they are working for? What if they experience an illness, injury, or health problem (in addition to that bad economic situation) which deems them unable to even work productively (at least for a while)? What if the ""host"" that the so-called ""parasite"" human is borrowing resources from is actually a ""bad person"" themselves who ""abuses"" them both emotionally, verbally, and physically in order to boost their ""egos"" to make themselves feel superior to the person they are ""helping""?....Is there actually a parasitic human, or are all people just human? Take for instance someone who is born into poverty, physically or mental abuse, or both. Are they parasites just because of this? Things they had no control over? Just because they are poor? What if this person decides to not make excuses and gets a job, but a recession hits that causes them to lose their job? Were they not a parasite before but now after they lose their job, which they cannot help, they are now? Perhaps most complexly, what if they people ""at the top"" are actually the ""Parasites""? (if there was one). Isn't it true that government workers and ""politicians"" live off of ""taxpayer money"" (aka taxpayer labor)? Isn't it true that a mega-rich corporate leader consumes the labor of their subordinates in order to make exponentially more money off of them? Doesn't this luxurious CEO or executive ""suck the blood"" and ""life"" out of their workers by forcing them to work harder, work overtime, sometimes work 60 hours a week or more (with the threat they will be demoted or lose their jobs if they do not)? And isn't it true that due to increase production or productivity, the executive makes even more money on the backs of their employees? Furthermore, cannot the corporation hold onto the laborers' paychecks for at least 2 weeks in order to reinvest it in stocks before paying it out to those who earned it two weeks prior as they wait for their paychecks?"

Working with basically two class defining sets Parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue. Director Joon Ho-Bong and cinematographer Kyong pyo Hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings, situations, jabs about class and characters early, equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way. It adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off. With no end game to the plot Ho-Bong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic."

Yep, a Will Ferrell comedy. ""Poor family outsmarts a clueless, out-of-touch rich family and takes over the house"" is absolutely a Will Ferrell comedy plot. Ignore how beautiful the movie looks: the poor family's cramped, dirty house and the rich family's pristine, futuristic house. Ignore the fact that it's a foreign film: There must be a least a few people who LOVED the film because it's in a different language and liking the film makes them smart. If this was a Will Ferrell movie or a Steve Martin movie and it had the same dialogue and zany schemes, you would think the movie was average. Or maybe even terrible. One scene included the daughter leaving her underwear in the rich parents' car to trick them into thinking the driver had sex in it. Maybe the Will Ferrell/Steve Martin comparison is a little bit melodramatic. My point is, if you set aside the fact that it's an immensely well made foreign film (on a technical level!), Parasite is weak when it comes to characters and storytelling. There are no memorable characters in this movie (except for maybe a character that showed up near the end of the film, but only because he was so over-the-top). A perfect example is the poor family. They're basically the same person. For the most part, the rich couple are the usual snooty, dimwitted suburban snobs we've seen in plenty of mainstream garbage comedies. Most of the story is just the exchange between the poor family and the rich family. The back-and-forth between them was interesting, but definitely not Oscar-worthy. It's a bit difficult to rate the acting if the movie is in a different language. As far as I can tell, the acting was just okay. No groundbreaking performances. Just people sitting (or standing) around and talking with a few wacky comedic moments. Oh and there's a murder at the end that feels out of place. Obviously, movie isn't terrible. The visuals were incredible. The scene where the poor family's neighborhood was consumed by a flood was gorgeous. I enjoyed the film, but I wouldn't say it's the greatest film ever."

But the plot in the basement and the overall comic tone in the second half, it lost me. It lost me even more that it's hailed as a masterpiece for Oscar.

I could see the appeal in this one, because it managed to be a little bit of everything, all in just one film. It was clever how the ""Poor"" family manipulated the ""Rich"" family and that element to start with was quite witty, but then things went in a different direction and all sorts of drama, horror and thrilling styles came in to play. I can only really compare it to 'From Dusk Till Dawn' (1996) in that respect, having had no idea of the twist that occurred in that one either. I'm not saying that there are definitely Vampires, but there could be. And actually anything could have happened as the story progressed with secrets and events that I hadn't even considered at the outset. The only other film that I could see similarities to would be 'The Handmaiden' (2016), also from South Korea and a film where things weren't always as they seemed either. I'm not sure how good the acting was in this one, because I find it really difficult with foreign language films to feel the emotion and that is certainly the case with Asian stories with their exaggerated humour elements akin to Anime or sometimes even those crazy Japanese game shows where the contestants are basically repeatedly tortured in a 'Krypton Factor' (1977-2013) style, but without the health and safety people on hand. I think the ""Rich"" Mum, Yeon Kyo was probably a bit over the top, although she appeared to fit quite well as the film progressed. Ultimately, what started out as quite a lighthearted and cheeky hustle film, very quickly became something severe and psychotic that was very dark and twisted in some very odd directions. I wouldn't say that I didn't like it, but I felt that there was a translation issue, although it did seem far easier to liken it to cinema of British or U. S. origin than others I've watched. It really would be hard to quantify as one type of film, but I suppose it would be best classed as a dark dramatic comedy? 635.67/1000."

It's cliche and has some bizarre plot lines that are interjected as a way out of obvious plot holes (plus some cheap entertainment value). Curiously absent from the Oscar nominations was Uncut Gems which I found to be more entertaining and powerful than Parasite and the others(almost passed over watching that one but decided to give it a go because Adam Sandler hasn't been funny in 15 years anyway so let's see him in a drama - he was brilliant)."

Can't say that about anyone else as they all had moments where they looked like they were ""acting"". I understand the metaphorical meaning and depth of the film which made it decent. I can handle ""can't-place-it-in-just-one-genre"" idea. However, there just is not enough there to make it Best Picture of the year. The powers that be were reaching to award something just to make their own point I think. It's not even in the same category as Joker and I typically don't like films that are gloomy and 70's-ish looking, but Joker was much better and was even similar to Parasite in some of it's lessons on humanity. I'm not saying Joker should be Best Picture either because I didn't see hundreds of movies last year to make that call, but it was the best I saw in 2019. If you can either understand the spoken language of Parasite or don't mind reading subtitles, then it's worth seeing--partially for the meaning, partially to say you saw it, partially so you can see for yourself that an ok movie can win Best Picture. Tune out the idea that you'll watch a comedy or a drama or a thriller or a horror movie--its a blending of a lot of things."

The story is great, the characters were fun and you got to know each, and the acting was spot on. The settings were great as wel. I thought it was a sci fi flick, but I truly knew nothing about it. I was expecting a thriller like Bug or The Fly or something weird like that. What I got was not disappointing. Very quirky which reflects the work of the director who brings an interesting flare to movies. He's definitely developed his signature style and I think it will make people visit this portfolio.

Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible."
imdb2500,genre mix comedy thriller difficult bring kinds reality extremes mix easily nature narrative demands dr strangelove comic half slow deals infiltration wealthy naïve family streetwise poor action develops lines half atmosphere created half carries surreal edge subsequent action sufficiently thrilled horrified brave attempt left feeling bit numb lack solid centre themes trivial comic themes disturbing entertaining bit tasteless,6,"Daring, original, but doesn't quite hang together",2020-02-29,imdb,"I've often thought that the genre mix of comedy - thriller is the most difficult to bring off. Somehow the two different kinds of reality, in their extremes, don't mix easily, unless the very nature of the narrative demands it, as in Dr Strangelove. The comic first half is somewhat slow, and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family, by a streetwise poor one. However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified. A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb. It all seemed to lack any solid centre, with serious themes looking trivial, and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining. All a bit tasteless, really."

What do I mean with that? Well, I will get into that late, but firstly; it was directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is best known for his English language movies ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"". Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple, they at least try to have an atmosphere. They also have a clear message, which however show a very naïve perspective on reality. Even his previous Korean language movies like ""mother"" and ""the host"" are very similar in that fashion. ""Parasite"" however doesn't really show much of that regard. Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere, which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen (with the exception of the masterpieces ""Burning"" and ""April snow""). ""Parasite"" however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies. But that's the only thing good about the movie however, maybe besides the production value. The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it. It is lacking in many other departments however. The characters, for example are terribly written. They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring, because of its focus on the characters. The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere, often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes (which shows that the production value wasn't well spend in all places). The acting is decent, considering the director. Nothing bad, but also nothing extraordinary. The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing. So overall I would say this movie was pretty mediocre, that's why I said its pretty Korean. It had a nice idea but doesn't do much with it and only uses it for shock value. It has very uninteresting character and sometimes feels very boring because of it. It is ultimately a very forgettable movie and the only reason I will probably remember it is because it is overhyped by many (kinda like the Korean movie ""Oldboy"")"

Without any doubt or fear of being wrong, this movie does NOT deserve the academy award. The film has the opportunity to develop stories and is left with superfluous scenes. It tries to tell the injustices that a family of employees receives and, honestly, it fails to move the viewer. I find it extremely strange that so many people have praised a film that is far from innovative. The script is bad, at the very least, it could have told a story ten times better.

I discover this almost by accident because I had no idea that he was behind Snowpiercer and the Netflix produced, Okja. I couldn't get through the first one and I fell asleep during the second. I gave this one a shot even though I knew that hyped movies are not my cup of tea. They seem to be self-reliant on the hype they generate, that somehow should be enough to reassure us, they'll leave us with an unforgettable memory. So while this movie isn't bad and technically well-made, is far from unforgettable. It's heavy-handed and pushes the device of the screwball comedy far enough to make its subversion and consequent transformation into carnage, less plausible. A mechanism very dear to French director Francois Ozon, who Bong Joon-ho seems to be definitely indebted to. A movie that certainly pleases the crowds with its grotesque and cynical satire and its deliberate use of violence. To quote Calvino: ""What many consider to be the vitality of the times - noisy, aggressive, revving and roaring - belongs to the realm of death, like a cemetery for rusty old cars."""

Given that they all have an eye for exploiting other people for money, how did they become so poor in the first place, unless there was some kind of sudden divine inspiration? And is uncouth behavior all the working class would like to achieve once given the opportunity to become rich? Although the movie seems to be compassionate with the poor as a first impression, it does the au contraire from a class perspective. The naive and gullible rich are defrauded by the covetous poor! Shouldn't be like, the rich are covetous so they have become rich? The acting is mediocre if not bad compared to other Korean movies such as Handmaiden or 3-iron. All in all, it is a so-so movie which nobody will lose anything if not watches."

They don't have to be rom coms, it doesn't seem to matter what the genre, most (of course not all) leave you not just entertained but are thought provoking too. With this in mind and all the hype and awards this film received, I felt that I should watch it. I can take weird, some parts of many K dramas are a bit weird but in a good or at least tolerable way. It wasn't that I didn't understand what the writer was trying to convey, I just felt it was all over the place, with no actual storyline. K dramas are not like US or UK dramas, they are basically one long film divided into episodes which allows complex characters, touching and thought-provoking moments and interesting story lines to develop. For this reason, the film felt really short to me. I'm so disappointed. The acting was good but I felt the sofa scene and ending in very poor taste not to mention the unbelievable recovery of the son! I think I will stick to my well selected K dramas and definitely avoid this writer from now on.

Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get. I keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer (paraphrasing) ""a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different"" - yeah, becomes a big stinker."

We sit at a safe distance and revel in the ""bravery"" of the film because it allows us to ignore our own flaws. It is by no means a bad film. Just not a particularly interesting one."

But so many people told me how ""amazing"" and different it was and kept recommending that I see it. So after it won all these awards and they put it back in my local theater I broke down and saw it. Well, that was a waste of $13.50 and two hours. It's billed as a genre bending comedy/drama, but in my opinion it misses on both fronts. There's nothing especially humorous in the dialogue or even the situations. Poor family scams rich family for jobs and money. Ooh, that's so original, except that it's not. The fact that the poor family is so unsympathetic makes it just unbearable. They're vile and annoying. Is it a clever commentary on class structure in Korea? Not really. Just hamfisted platitudes. The rich couple come off as far more likeable in fact. As for drama, there really isn't much. Yeah, they try to take a dark turn towards the end and there is a feeble attempt to make things dramatic, but I just kept looking at my watch wondering when this bore-fest would end. Then it just kept dragging on. And for the record, I spend lots of time in Asia, including Korea. I've seen lots of Asian films. I have Asian relatives and an Asian spouse. It's not cultural misunderstanding here. I just think, like that similarly shallow representation of mental illness in the even more boring ""Joker"" film, people want to praise something that they think brings attention to some uncomfortable issue. Guess what? Variations of this class structure have existed in Korea for hundreds of years. Things are better now than they were. There are plenty of options that don't involve scamming and murder. But if you can feel better about yourself by claiming to empathize with the lower economic stratum by suffering through this film, more power to you."

After viewing Parasite, I can say that it's not a bad movie by any means; I just don't see what everyone else does. I don't see how this movie achieved everything it has. Again I don't think it's a bad movie, but I don't think it is as great and amazing as everyone thinks it is. I understand this is a very unpopular take, I don't want to turn anyone away, but I also don't think anyone should go in with high expectations, because it's possible that they will be disappointed like I was. Like I said, it's not a bad film; but I personally don't think it's a 10/10 either."

It's too plain and mediocre. Nothing special about the story, nothing about the characters. The plot twist, if you may call it that, is weak at best. The decorations were built with great attention to detail, but they don't create any striking image. Except maybe the elevated toilet. But do you really think a toilet is enough to earn the praise that this movie gets? The parallel events that happen to the two families are very obviously parallel, you don't even have to watch the movie to see it. The title of the movie - yeah, we get that, who is actually the parasite, very subtle, haha. Ironically, this doesn't get more obvious after watching. The moral? Well, dubious at best. I hope they were not trying to justify the murder by the distaste to the smell of the people on the subway. But in this case, what is this movie about? It's kinda empty, has nothing to say. The actors play fine, nothing above or below average. Then, a few words about humor. This movie is listed as comedy. Yeah, it uses some typical comedic moves, like the impostor family hiding below the table. But none of those are funny. Most of these moments are just cringeworthy. I don't know if the director was going for this emotion, and even if he did it successfully, I'm not appreciating it. As a comedy, this film is far below mediocre. So what's the big deal about Parasite?"

But Give Those Who Rave About It Some Slack,2020-02-15,imdb,"This movie strongly reminded me of several different things as I watched it, the first was American Beauty. A film with a strong experiential component that is not matched by its actual message or ""literary"" value, and as such overrated in the moment and forgotten with time. Parasite is a very well composed and executed film, in terms of emotional engagement with the story and characters it gets you all dressed up and it's easy to feel as if you must have had somewhere to go. But you didn't. The second was 'Let the Right One In'. That was a good movie that was basically rated 2 stars higher than it deserved by everyone in the United States because it had subtitles. Exotic and slightly more challenging to watch is easily conflated with quality by people who aren't especially self-perceptive in their thinking. Had Let the Right One In been in English and set in New York, well, the dumb and silly parts would have just seemed dumb and silly, and it would have had to stand entirely on its own quality, and not an imagined quality. Parasite is the same way. If it starred four American actors trying to get jobs as household help in LA, people would be quite meh about it. Actually given the nature of the plot, I think most people in America currently giving it a 10 would probably be a little insulted by screwball comedy plot that simultaneously seems to fawn over its own profundity, and would give it a lower rating than my 5 stars. And third, this movie can't help but make me think of America's original class conscious, degenerately poor sitcom family, the Bundys from Married with Children. They even match by character: the intelligent but lame son, the beautiful but still poor sister who connives to get what she wants, the dead-eyed father crushed by life, and the ball-busting mother who really doesn't make anyone feel better. Just like the Bundy's they're comically poor while placed in a real life setting where anyone with their talents, willingness to work, and lack of any significant vices means they would at worst be regular poor. And probably decently well off. They're also selectively stupid when required to be in order to make the plot work, which seems a little more forgivable in a weekly sitcom where the writers are forced to create drama dozens and dozens of times a year, but less so in a movie where they don't."

Of all the films to break the barrier and be the first, they chose THIS? When will all this self loathing end? I guess never because as long as humans are alive there will always be hordes of abysmally depressed people who think the more they hate humanity and the ways of the world they more self righteous they'll feel about ""calling it out"". What a joke. While the film is extremely well made its story is soulless and not as intelligent of a critique of capitalism, egalitarianism, and meritocracy as the snobs make it seem. At this point it's the ultimate cliche. It play more like a weak melodrama/soft noir movie. It's just a weird film that meanders and is only occasionally entertaining. Some good humor and interesting situations that hold you in brief suspense. Other than that the only interesting parts are seeing Korean culture in cinema. I'd love to visit some time. But this movie is trash. The overall message of the movie is life sucks, so why even try? It amazes me that the director can even reconcile the conflict within himself. I'm sure he tried VERY hard to make this a great movie, as he does with all his films. He tried so hard he even won 3 Oscar's with this one. He worked very hard for decades to gain the knowledge and skills to be able to pull this off and I know for a fact it's made him rich. Does he hate his own success? Should he have not ever tried and just remained a dreamer? Should he never have strove to be a great director? If he really feels this way about success and achievement he never should have accepted that Oscar. He should donate all his money to charity and live a destitute life because hey, life sucks for so many people, so why even try? Give me a break. The entire premise of the movie is JOKE. How immature and sad one must be to love this movie. 2 hours of life just wasted."

It may be in part explained by not really associating with people who do enjoy foreign language films. Anyway with it's success at the Oscars, Parasite seemed to be deserving of a watch, so saw it on the big screen a couple of days ago. Stylistically it seemed very similar to a Tarantino movie to me. The characters were gripping and the dialogue was excellent. Would have been so much more enjoyable if I understood Korean though. The movie explores the tensions in the class divide which is obviously a universal theme which everyone understands. The sets are excellent and so realistic you can imagine how you'd feel yourself yourself in the scenes. It's well worth a watch and if you don't share my dislike of subtitles you'll probably love this movie."

The story is interesting but not excessively. The characters are all paper thin and one dimensional. Their motivations and actions are not justified. E.g. the main murder is almost comically undeserved, serving only the useless final plot twist. Americans must not have seen any Korean movies before because this tone is very common. There was nothing exceptional about this film but it probably surprised American audiences with many aspects unfamiliar to them. That is the only reason I can imagine this won the academy award. And best director? Really? No. Definitely not. Any director that can't justify major main character actions with his or her storytelling still needs some work,not an academy award."

Films such as ""The Way Home"", ""The Handmaiden"", and ""Train to Busan"" are indeed great within their respective genres, and are testaments to South Korea's rising acclaim in world cinema. Parasite is not on the same level as the aforementioned titles. Instead it is quite typical of mediocre SK movies - choppy, childish at moments, and the dialogue isn't highly cerebral. It wasn't great nor was it bad. I'm not sure what all the hype was about with regards to it deserving of an Oscar for Best Picture either. I think people in the United States simply haven't seen enough SK movies to truly appreciate the breadth of cinematic entertainment that SK has to offer. Perhaps with Parasite, it must be the novelty of glorifying criminality in a very conservative society that's piqued critics' and American viewers' interests.

Most of the events looked fixed, unlike other korean movies where the realism was better and the tension was real. Until the end I was expecting some great twist, similar to the Cabin in the Woods for example, but no, it was just a massacre that was actually expected and it got executed poorly and in a naive way. I really just don't get it why is this hype, the movie is ok, sometimes difficult to watch because it's long and slow sometimes, kind of watchable, but definitely not a master piece, far from it.

This is definitely not better than Joker. Joker is a masterpiece in every way and this is just alright. Why people love this movie so much is beyond me. It's not bad or anything but it's not nearly as good as people make it out to be. If you want a movie with an original scenario you'll want to check it out. But everything else about this movie is just alright. It's not mind blowing or anything, not at all. The music isn't fascinating, the acting is good but not Oscar worthy and the cinematography is just alright. Joker should've won the Oscar. Joker is amazing and this is not. This is mediocre at best. If you think this movie is better than Joker, you are delusional. I get that taste is subjective and all but literally everything about Joker is better than this mediocre piece of cinema."

The character building, the interpersonal relations, and the little scheme of the family was more than enough. Then, the second half they turn to over-the-top dramatics, plot twists and drizzle on some moral preaching at the end. The movie could have been just as great without it, simply because the casting, writing, and development in the first half was incredible."

And....like many reviewers here, I am baffled as to why this movie garnered so many accolades from Cannes to Hollywood. It is brilliantly filmed and well acted, but when it comes to its script, I can think of many more efficient, more subtle, less simplistic movies tackling class warfare with the purpose of entertainment. Indeed, Italian comedies of the 1960s and 70s were masters in that field, and they did it with fearless gusto, caustic laughs, perverse subtlety -and no artificial twists like in Parasite. I can watch over and over ""Bread And Chocolate"" (1974, with Nino Mandredi) or any Ettore Scola movie of the same period (try ""Ugly, Dirty and Bad"", 1976, for great fun!). I don't think i will remember Parasite in 3 days."

I don't know how to put it, well it's kind of boring most of the time. It's too hyped up. I don't agree with the portrayal of the classes - the rich guys are idiots (how did they become rich), the poor guys are smart and cunning (why are they poor then?) and then we get the ""big reveal moment"" in the movie and from then on it just dies out. There's something not right with the film, I just can't put my finger on in. Intelectually speaking, the film discusses the classic societal and class problems. It's like the ""Malevich Square"", there will be a million different interpretations to it's meaning. I don't know if the director intended for it to be anything deep and to have many different layers - but anyone is free to make his own judgement. I didn't like the ending, it's got the classical blood thirsty ending that so many asian movies have that it's almost cliche. In the end I think it's overrated, this is a solid 5, it's watchable but that's it for me."

I was expecting a deep dive psychological thriller and got confused along the way with the message it was trying to relay to the viewer... how can others say this was some deep discussion on class differences when the poor cant fold boxes, are con artists and liars, and the rich are a well off family that work hard and care for each other, whose only crime was having a bad smell problem... its not riveting, its weak. There were so many plotholes and missed opportunities. This film was extremely predictable yet offensive to whoever this film was intended for, rich or poor... who are you supposed to root for? Definitely not the poor con artists, and if thats done on purpose it shows a tremendous pretentiousness. Its an average well done movie, receiving high praise because it was korean made... ive seen better in the last 10 years. By all means, watch it though."

You know how a celebrity starts a trend and ten years later no one can believe that was fashionable and it actually was horrendous. I get that vibe here, because the film is so unique and Let's the viewer decipher the plot, people are saying this is great because it's thought provoking, similar to a tate modern peice of art, red splash of paint worth 5 million because the artist is famous. Anyway, as you can tell I'm not that keen on the film but didn't hate it, just left confused to the over inflated ratings, reviews and awards. Go in sceptical and you may far better than me."

If you step onto a boat, it doesn't suddenly turn into a submarine or a bus, but this movie does. It starts out so improbable that it's funny, then gets mean, vicious, violent, tragic and depressing. Others have said that it's an allegory about the class differences between the haves and have-nots. My eyeballs roll at this. So what! Life isn't fair. That is no excuse for one-dimensional characters. A family of grifters that is too stupid to succeed at anything somehow manages to cleverly con its way into the lives of a wealthy family. Of course, this must end somehow or there'd be no tension. You know something is going to eventually happen as the unexpected fortune of the poor family cannot continue, but why does it have to end in such gratuitous violence? What kind of person likes watching that? It makes you feel guilty about laughing during the comedic sections earlier in the movie."

Just so overhyped, which kinda ruined it with me. I feel like people like this just because it's so politically right, like what happened with black panther. Just because it's something you believe in doesn't mean it's good. I felt like it was way too long. And how did this get an Oscar over 1917, which is obviously superior especially in the visual category. I just don't understand why so many people like this mediocre film."

I WANTED to love this movie. But as soon as I saw the Palm D'Or logo at the beginning of the movie I knew they were telling me I was supposed to like it and find it intellectual. I didn't. Still don't. The dialogue was bad. The story was meh and none of the tension came from between characters. The most tense movie came from when they were hiding under the table in a will they or won't they be found. Honestly, the same scene played out in Jurassic Park but with the dinosaurs vs the humans. I actually like Jurassic Park more."

The movie is OK but far from ""best of the decade"" to be honest. When watching the movie I felt that I was always 2 or 3 seconds ahead of the plot, which (especially the first half) vibes like that of a cliche sitcom show, squeezed and polished (really hard) into an ""artsy"" crowd-pleasing movie. This whole unprecedented praise around the movie, which I guess I will never understand, somehow reminds me of the fanatics about Kpop, which, (un)surprisingly, shares the initial ""K""."

Some things are not connected well and what in the high point of the movie happens doesn't satisfy me. In the cinema, I was literally like: ohh when will everything explose, the action should start soon. At the end of the movie, everything blows up, but it's not how you expected it.

While it won a few I was shocked to see parasite win so many. A few weeks later I decided to rent the movie and watch. And after 2 hours I can say that I don't think it's all that great. Let's start with the positives. I enjoyed the comedy. There were several bits that had me laughing. They were probably not in the same spots others would usually laugh but nevertheless I thought the movie was decently funny. I thought the acting was pretty good too. Both sides of the family pulled off a pretty believable take on the rich and the poor. But that's all I can really say I liked about the movie. About halfway into the movie I turned to the person I was watching it with and told them that ""This movie must get pretty great within the next 45 minutes amiright"" I had heard so much about the many twists and turns of the movie and I can say that they're really wasn't ever a big twist for me. I mean there was one. That one lead to the entire 3rd act of the movie so I can't really say it was all too surprising. As a person who has loved Movies since I was a mere lad I can say this wasn't anything too groundbreaking, and can definitely say if it was made the same exact way expect by an American, the movie would be perceived as sucky and unoriginal. I really tried to enjoy this movie but I just couldn't. Maybe someday I'll revisit it and see something in it."

I was really excited about that film. Now i am disappointed and wondering why people are so blown away by it. Its okay to watch on a sunday afternoon, but not more at all. I get that there is an underlying critical depiction of the korean two-class-society (that i as a middle class western can not really understand) but the storyline seems to far fetched and the behaviour and dialogue of the protagonists are not convincingly crafted. Maybe again, its the korean style, but nonetheless it wasnt convincing. Actually i waited for it to end."

However, the actors are all surprisingly likeable despite the content and actions. You feel for them and their situation, but at the same time, I feel the director portrays wealthy people in a very unfair light. It really is the immoral ones who are impacting others' lives with their actions, not the wealthy family. Overall this is worth a watch, but it is not worth 8.6 stars. Ridiculous."

What a disappointment. Is this the movie that has won all these awards and put Korea on the map? I sat through it waiting for something to spark my interest, anything that would raise this oriental potboiler social comedy of manners into high art. It failed to materialise. The acting is cartoony (perhaps it's supposed to be), the plot downright silly although I would say it had some originality and overall it just seemed pretty poor. It was neither satirically funny enough or dramatic enough to be a stunning black comedy. Far too aware of itself. I did want to like this. I was anticipating another ""Roma"" but all I got was a frantic mess."

Despite the movie calling itself comedy there were only a few places in between that were relatively funny. And therein lies the problem, the movie was undecided which genre it wants to be, drama, comedy, horror, action? The story depends on plot twists to keep it going, some are predictable some are unexpected, and some are outright stupid. I'm talking about the finale, it just looks out of nowhere and forced so the viewers don't end up with a lackluster ending. It's a bizarre flick, but in no way great. I'd give it a slightly higher rating but there's a need for counter-balance to all the reviews overrating this movie."

I'll go as far as to say the story was a very good premise and had incredible potential. BUT: No story is complete without good character development, and this is where this film fails CATASTROPHICALLY. Here it is in a nutshell: WHO CARES?! Besides the imposter family (protagonists) being of low economic status, the writers make almost no effort to make this family likeable in any way shape or form. They are all pretty much detestable scumbags right out of the gate. There is ZERO conflict of interest or moral dilemmas as the family goes about their con games - you know, the kind of writing that would normally draw the audience in and generate sympathy for the protagonists as they make their poor and ultimately tragic decisions. In any good tragic tale, the audience should feel conflicted in their emotions when the protagonists meet their ultimate fate, but this film achieves none of that, at least in my opinion. I was literally rooting for their downfall through the whole film. Honestly, how do you screw that up?! It's classic 101 storytelling. Honestly, if you feel sorry for this family in any form during this film, you're probably a sociopath - and the fact that this film is held in such great regard is very concerning."

But this film is mere tripe, it pales in comparison to the refinement, depth and complexity of the popular Adult Swim show, ""Richard and Mortimer"" (Rick and Morty for lower IQ individuals). In fact, the part in particular that has utterly taken my fancy is an episode wherein the titular ""Richard"" transforms himself into none other than a lacto-fermented cucumber, and proudly proclaims his new designation to be ""Pickle Rick""! Oh how I laughed, for this is true comedy, this is art. This film simply fails to compare to its better, and while I consider it above average as far as modern comedic films go, I simply cannot rate it higher than 4 stars. This is probably due to my incredibly high IQ. My name is Jeurel Barton, bury me with dislikes if you disagree"

However, the moral from Hans Christian Andersen's story 'The Emperors New Clothes', is: telling ourselves something is 'good' doesn't mean it is; and, that is very much the case for Parasite. In the main, the film isn't too bad. A poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy. The acting is only 'alright' but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say, and the viewer doesn't learn much about the wealthy family. The film also leaves many unanswered questions, such as: It's all a little silly really The film will appeal to: 1. Wave the flag of support for anything foreign 2. Think being 'politically correct' is a political party 3. Think transgender-ism is choice not a biological state If you haven't seen this, you're not missing much."

Then it turns into a catastrophe. No one can believe, even with simpletons as employers, that anyone could have hired the father and the mother who've been unemployed for so long, obviously because they're good to nothing. They're irresponsible heartless. The movie is overlong and mostly boring, the characters are unlikable. And it all ends in a screwball comedy which becomes a ridiculous gore horror movie. The screenplay is contemptible and I wonder what parts of the movie were so well directed that the director can claim having been influenced by Martin Scorsese. If I were Scorsese I'd resent it as an insult."

I feel like it was hyped up heavily pre-Oscars based on momentum / buzz, but the end product has me confused because there's absolutely nothing ground breaking here. Was it the fact that it was filmed in South Korea? Maybe people are so used to the K-pop fluff garbage coming from SK that when something of actual artistic substance is produced via their pop culture it gets blown out of proportion, when compared to their usual fare. Let me say now, Parasite is in no way a bad movie. It has something to say, the plot is decent, and it is well shot. But the plot line and story itself isn't really saying anything new or different that hasn't been done via Hollywood in the past. I also felt like some of the performances weren't A+ material, probably why the film wasn't nominated for any actual acting awards. The main male child and dad did good enough work, the daughter and mom, and the members of the ""rich"" family? Not so much. Basically throwaway performances. Again, not a ""bad"" film, but if you are looking for a revolutionary vision and message, keep looking."

The main theme of the film is status, class and betrayal. However, I think the film fails to make these themes compelling and thought-provoking enough to motivate the audience to care about the characters. The first half is extremely uninteresting and it is difficult to not be sickened by the actions of the family, despite their poor economic background. There is some intrigue at the second half but to be honest I found the overall structure of the film's plot to be too chaotic and convoluted. compelling enough. As a result, there is something missing from the film. The events that occur within the film are quite surreal and hokey. Some are the scenes are downright bizarre and made you wonder why the character said that in such a melodramatic, unrealistic way. This affects the believability in what you're seeing, thus negatively affecting any sense of connection with the characters. Forgettable."

I'm not saying it was bad, but it just didn't appeal to me as other movies of this genre. In my country we come across these types of scenarios all the time about the less fortunate families and what they have to do to survive etc so maybe to me the story wasn't so out of the ordinary and I've seen worse on the news.

Can't decide what tone it wants to have, can't conclude a story, instead doing the most open-ended ending in the history of endings...

And frustrated... And this won awards and is so overhyped? Let's back up. The concept is nice and simple - ""Parasite"" doesn't stand for yet another zombie movie, but rather a social parasite - a bunch of manipulative poor people slink their way into working for a rich family and eventually even living in their house. It's a decent comedy, fairly original, but it's just... soooo... loooong.... Over 2 hours that feel like 5, and a lot of it is just boring talk that should've been cut. Because if that was done - this would've been a great comedy. Not ""ha ha!"" funny, but still quirky and weird enough to bring a smile to someone's face. But it's long, not that funny, not that well written (borders on kid show-style comedy), and since it also doesn't have a single likeable character, I can't say I loved it. I know idiots will write about ""metaphors"" and what not, even though this movie is basically beating you across the face with what it's about - there's no metaphors - don't expect anything too deep. Or deep at all. The ending was pretty predictable, and shall we say -- NOT GOOD AT ALL, so yeah... I didn't really get much laughs out of this, it wasn't very interesting, and it ended in a way that made me feel like I really wasted my time there."

I really enjoyed Bong Joon-ho's Memories of a Murder and Mother. Unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches. The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father, pretentious and anxious mother, the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set, and finally the moody, withdrawn awkward daughter. The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid. The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls. For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next. Most notably, how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune? See the movie and you'll see how ridiculous that is. The Morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose. Movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened."

While I'm here I'll recommend a Korean film that WAS deserving of its acclaim, Oldboy. See it, or see it again (it rewards repeat viewings).

If you're a film critic you might like this movie for the reasons that all the other film critics do. If you're an average moviegoer who wants a movie with characters to relate to and a story to inspire and remember you would be disappointed. The first half of the movie is way too long in setting up the premise, you don't realize what the movie turns out to be until the second half making me feel like the first half consisted of too many irrelevant details and was way too long. By the time the movie picks up pace you're already tired. I found myself skipping every thirty seconds towards the end. Secondly, a great movie should leave you with a positive feeling, either a feeling of hope or inspiration or if neither of those are possible atleast the satisfaction of having had a good laugh. This movie does none of that, it leaves you with a feeling of despair and hopelessness. Sadly that is what passes for art these days. There were some good parts about the movie, such as the acting was top-notch especially from the sister. Cinematography was good too but the movie was just not deserving enough to be the best picture of the year.

Plot has a multiple and serious goofs and all the screenplay seems to be a pretension for the director/writer to express all of his ideas about injustice and cruelty of modern Korea and of course the world. In order to do that in good cinematic manner, a writer should first write a good screenplay that the plot twists come from the characters and believable situations and then the director visualizes it in his point of view to accomplish his ideas, something we saw in great Ken Loach movie, ""I, Daniel Blake"".I exampled this movie because it has same theme about injustice. Of course Bong Joon ho is a great writer/director and i love ""Memories of Murder"",""Mother"" and ""Snowpiercer"", but after seeing this movie i was disappointed,as simple as that!"

I saw it with an afternoon audience who were mostly in their ""twilight"" years and the majority of comments at the end expressed puzzlement that this was the best picture of 2019. Lack of laughter during the performance implied that the film missed its' mark as a comedy. Perhaps its' role as a satirical social commentary of the gulf between the poor and the rich in South Korea might have been hitting targets but surely that would only be appreciated by a minority audience. Personally, I felt that Ho had been given a box set of Ealing comedies made by the likes of Alexander Mackendrick, Charles Crichton, Robert Hamer and Henry Cornelius and simply transferred the tone to a South Korean environment. Of course the influence of Hollywood's ""wild man"", Quentin Tarantino,had to appear in order to appeal to a modern audience and of course it is there in the second half. I can only imagine that nowadays, the voters at Cannes and the Academy are made up of people too young to remember films such as ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"",""Whisky Galore"",""The Lavender Hill Mob"" and ""Hue and Cry"". Otherwise they would have realised that what is being exhibited is not ""new"" and different but is a retread of old classics. I've watched ho's ""The Host"" and ""Snowpiercer"" and can't help but feel that he has potential but is not the maestro some,usually sensible, film critics claim. For one thing he needs to tighten up the pace of his storylines and keep to a central theme without going off at a tangent. There is also a whiff of patronisation here which implies that everyone in the ""industry"" were surprised that a South Korean could come up with a global hit. The moneymen are surely thinking that this is not a breakout hit for Ho but a breakin hit into a lucrative South East Asian market. Would it be the same hit if it had not been awarded ""Best Picture""? I doubt it very much."

Then getting other people fired to take their jobs... and then it all ends in murder? I'm not confused by the plot, but rather confused about why people love this so much. Granted, it's probably just not my thing. I tend to not like movies where most of the characters are terrible people and there's basically no redeeming qualities. Classics that people love, ""Gone with The Wind"" and ""Grease"", are two movies I hate. This movie did nothing for me, other than leaving me confused on it's point. If you loved it, that's fine. I'm not trying to hate on this movie, or people who like it, I just don't get the hype. After watching a video explaining the themes a bit more, I decided to add two more stars to my rating.

I think I would have enjoyed it more if I had not wasted over 2 hours that would have been better spent digging for worms to fish with or eating a bowl of frosted flakes with bananas and strawberries (which would have been more appetizing). 90 minutes would have done it for me....make that 45 minutes. Way too much hype for a theatrical mess. Maybe best foreign film but best movie of the year, ha. Just goes to show the Academy is screwed up.

But, also it really isnt that good as reviews and awards suggest, at least for me. Maybe i expected too much but nothing really revolutionary happens here. It has few funny scenes and a plot- twist like any other thriller/comedy approach. Social topics covered here didnt really touch me at all. I didnt feel bad for the poor nor for Parks family. Didnt even think about the movie after it was done, whilst i thought about every other oscar rewarded movie for a long time after watching.

The first hour went well with the tight plot and realistic situations and performance by the characters but somehow it lost its grip in the second half and characters strangely appeared overdoing.

This is like a 1960's Carry On film, but just with present day styling, but when brilliant movies such as City of God cannot even get to the short list of Best Foreign Picture you have to wonder why the Academy saw fit to elevate this to its top award ..... basically its not fit too lace the boots of COG, and is certainly not a patch on Joker or 1917.

I really appreciate what the Korean artists try out with the cinematographic art. This movie has created a lot of hype in the industry ... even got an Oscar ; by watching the cover and the title, i didn't want to watch this movie. But then it got recommended by a very close friend of mine (who's working in Korean affairs). I gave it a shot ... and ... i was right ; ... i didn't like this movie. To me, i didn't find the ""humour"" amusing (although quite a lot of Korean movies are really good with humour). The story itself was pathetic (however that is the point with a title like ""Parasite""). The end (which for me started at the point they were getting hammered) was overly long and messy. All that being said though, the actors are really good ; the screenplay is most times well done (although too many close ups) ; but frankly ... it is overhyped. I think this movie responds more to those being bourgeois."

It's political. The weirder, more topical and more virtue signaling that goes on, the more a film will capture the actors and directors who vote for Oscar candidates. This movie was seen by less than 1.5% of the US citizenry. Take a look at the cast and ask yourself what else you've seen them in. It's Korean based so likely either nothing, or maybe one other film. Additionally, in this day and age of jaded critics, if something is strange and unusual, well, that'll get press. Didn't mean it's good. It'll be interesting to see if this film stands the test of time. Frankly, I highly doubt it."

The main reason for me is because there was no character development. More specifically, there was nothing in any of the characters that made me care about them so the whole movie is just things happening and nothing at stake from a viewer's perspective. Nothing that happens is particularly shocking or twisted either- I might even say that it's fairly predictable. Going back to my main point, didn't care for any of the events that happened. Even if I didn't know about the hype beforehand I can objectively say it was just a boring movie. For me anyway."

Incredible waste of 2 hours plus watching it. I don't even know why I gave it a 3 as I found nothing in it that really was of interest. How the Academy could give this Best Picture is beyond me. Ok I see it could get Best Foreign Film but NOT Best Picture. 1917 was a much better and well made film. If I wanted to listen to the babble of dialogue in this I just have to step onto the street of any major city or town. Another thing that gets me fumed these days is why credits are so small they can hardly be read. Even the title PARASITE is so small it cannot be read on. TV screen at least. And when will Producers realise RED CREDITS (not in this film) can never be read when shown on TV. I know I will be condemn by many reviewers on here but we all have a choice in what we want to watch. Actually I quite enjoyed this Director's SNOWPIERCER.

The acting is average, there is little character development that is compelling, the script is boring, zero humor.

Awards for film are meaningless and superficial. I've never been a fan of the art house genre. However, I do appreciate the films of David Lynch, and I believe he's the only one that has turned art house into a fine art form. I bet five dollars that the six hour long sequel to this film never sees the light of day at HBO. It's too soon after the disaster that was GoT. Parasite was too slick and packaged for mainstream consumption. Much like the human branding it so desperately tried to spotlight. I could think of a hundred foreign films the Academy passed over for Best Picture for some American made drivel. This film was not one of them. Down with all awards shows!"

This did so pretty quickly my, against my better judgment I decided to use up my gift card proceeds on this turkey. (Mainly because it is more and more difficult to find a Barnes & Noble that sells DVD's.) This had the potential to have been a very pleasant diversion, reminiscent of the American screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's, when it decided to go over the top and embrace every genre but comedy (and Westerns.) The film concerns two Korean families, the haves and the have-nots The haves are composed of computer exec dad and his faux sophisticated wife and their two children, the teenage daughter, studying English to achieve success on college entrance exams and a junior whiz-kid artist whose works are obviously normal scribbling. In the course of her studies the daughter has the services of a college student who has decided to take a sabbatical and recommends his friend, a non-college educated but English fluent son of the have-nots as his replacement. The son quickly sizes up his new employers and sees room on the job for sis as a art therapy expert who would be just the person to expose junior's genius to the world. Eventually the entire have-not family become ""parasites"" feeding from the prosperous haves. All vestiges of any comedy then disappear and philosophy seems to take its place. It is not a welcome change. Watch it at your own risk considering the source of all enthusiastic comments that might tend to sway you."

Why? It's not close to get even 1 Oscar. 7 stars was for a little sympathy for the Korean films. But getting undeserved 5 Oscar's has let me lose all the sympathy for this film. A Bollywood kind ending was terrible enough. The social message of the film has also big problems which bothered me during watching it. A low class family manipulate a rich family to infiltrate, taking advantage of them, lying and cheating, doing harm to other poor people, letting lose their jobs, is not a way to show a way to get attention to the class differences. I'm very disappointed in the Academy Awards. There has been many good foreigner films in last decade and non has won any decent prize."

There was another reviewer who gave a low rating that said ""did we watch the same movie?"". That's exactly the feeling I got after watching the movie.

This feels like one of those films by a director that has grand ideas but actually very little experience in the real world (that leads to what can only be described as pretentious outcomes). Now by ""experience of the real world"" I don't mean that the films premise needed to be more grounded, far from it, some of the most outlandish unbelievable (heck even total fantasy) stories can feel grounded thanks their attention to detail that make them (or their world) believable. I mean here that the details/this world is so unbelievable that the whole experience is boring/an insult. This manifests itself most prominently in the character's and their development. There are collections of character traits bundled and attached to two main groups of characters: poor and rich.

This falls apart almost immediately when the poorer family show signs of being sloppy (they can't be bothered to fold the pizza boxes properly and do not understand what's wrong when there is complaint) yet have meticulous attention to detail (they perform an A-class service to the richer family on demand?). Both seemingly motivated by their want for money. If they were indeed driven by money via attention to detail, they would have had a million opportunities in-between these extremes. This inconsistency leads me to view this as a poor treatment of the ""poor person"" stereotype and much less than being a statement on society this film is actually an embarrassing statement on the directors ignorance. This is forgivable, not all directors have had the world experience and who is to stop them from making a film? It looks nice at least. What is not forgivable is that the Oscars can't see this for what it is (nor the endless reviewers). The pretentiousness therefore is mirrored in the critics praise - they think they understand a clever observation on society, but all they are revealing is their own poor understanding of class and how people work. Forgivable again perhaps for the average viewer, but critics with large audiences? There's your statement on society: people with loud voices haven't got a ******* clue."

If we are to feel anything for this family, they need to hold some values we can warm to. The suggestion that they are hard-working well-meaning individuals simply down on their luck is once again rendered unbelievable when they take the nasty decision to harm the original house made of the house. There is no dog-eat-dog need to do this, again if they used the smarts on display within this household outside of this household, they would inevitably be more successful and have less need to do this. Yet it is this utterly flawed down-on-luck narrative that upholds the social commentary of ""unfair class divides"" that apparently makes this film amazing. The treatment of the rich is also highly flawed. If they are (as many critics have read from this) representations of greed and ignorance, why is the mother then only one that seems to be treating people kindly and fairly?"

I started to wonder how this won awards. What's the main theme of this movie? Social inequality and class differences... that's fine... I am not against this one. It's a global one. The issue needs to be addressed in many countries. But the story and screenplay were so poorly done. In India, we too have many social inequality issues in our society. Many films had highlighted those issues in a very convincing way. Especially, the climax scenes (the garden party scene) are so poorly written in this movie. Poorly written and overrated!!!"

Logic is terrible, ethical implications are vague at best (leaning toward anti-ethical), social justice or meritocracy messages are completely mislead and unrealistic, and the ending is just a fantasy...

However, in my opinion, the film falls short of its hype. While the premise of a lower-class family infiltrating a wealthy household is intriguing, the execution is heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. The characters are one-dimensional and lack depth, with the lower-class family being portrayed as cunning and deceitful, and the wealthy family as naive and ignorant. The film's attempts at social commentary feel forced and preachy, with the message of class struggle being hammered home repeatedly. Furthermore, the film's pacing is slow and uneven, with long stretches of exposition and character development that feel drawn out and unnecessary. The final act, while shocking, is also predictable and lacks emotional impact due to the lack of investment in the characters. Overall, Parasite is a film that is overhyped and overrated. While it may appeal to those who enjoy heavy-handed social commentary, those looking for a more nuanced and subtle exploration of class struggle will be disappointed. Despite its critical acclaim, I found Parasite to be a disappointing and forgettable film."

There's an almost complete lack of sympathy for, or empathy in, almost all of the selfish, unpleasant characters. Maybe that's the point, but if you want a film where there's someone to root for, this isn't for you. Although you can see the point the film makes writ large from an early stage, it does a poor job of making you think the downtrodden deserve any sympathy."

Absolutely all of his characters work, regardless of social class, and the fact that the main characters received jobs in a rich house somewhat fraudulently can be found almost at every step, there was nothing particularly shocking. If the main rich man of the film were the personification of all the nasty things that the bourgeoisie can associate with, then it would be much more powerful. That is, if, for example, he beat his wife, mistreated children and a maid, went to the left, threw tantrums for no reason, then one could still understand the wave of indignation of the father of a poor family, indignation that reached its climax in the finale. But this is NOTHING. We see a peaceful family, a caring father and mother who love children and really do everything they can for them. From here follows the conclusion from the opposite: if the main rich people of the film are decent people, a loving family, then I would like to see the embittered, humiliated and offended poor people, which would play on this contrast. But this is NOTHING. Both of them love each other, everyone loves children, there is plenty of respect between family members, there is simply NO contrast, an antagonist in the film. In general, I do not understand why such films receive Palme d'Or. There is a much more poignant movie, underestimated by critics, not getting anything. There are many such films. And here for what, well, for what? For timing? For a beautiful picture or a good game of actors? This is now easy to do if you try a little. But the fact that the main thing in the film is very false - the PLOT, this cannot be corrected by anything."

Bleak. Pessimistic. Wasted Opportunity.,2023-11-07,imdb,"It starts off somewhat light-hearted. It then shows how people act inauthentically to fulfill certain role expectations, and to manipulate people in order to be accepted (and paid). It explores the hypocrisy of prejudice and how people slip into an 'us and them' mentality. It alludes to how people feed off each other. It had potential to then provide some sort of moral undertones - to provide some sort of remedy; perhaps through the characters having realisations that lead them to make positive changes. Perhaps even leading them to humility, redemption or reconciliation. But it pretty much just veers off into a horror movie. It tries to be clever with allusions and metaphors about unconscious and repressed psychological forces. And perhaps there is some allegory for the North/South Korea divide in there as well. But the story becomes so over the top in its efforts to disturb, that it loses credibility. If you want to wallow in pseudo-intellectual generalisations about socio-economic class conflict and long outmoded Freudian theories of psychological neuroses, then this might be a movie for you.

The culture and art of these and other Asian countries get hyped ferociously in the west. I am not saying that I mind, people can like whatever they want and there is so much intriguing and nice to like but it does have this unpleasant side effect that films like this are treated like pure gold. This film is not, for me. I heard much about this film, read many great reviews it being incredibly funny, frightening, disturbing, dramatic and and and. A Film that should have won all prices as best competitor in all genres(a part from adult and children's movies). So I watched it expecting it to be dark, smart and deep and at the same time entertain me and make me laugh, and cry at best. But it did not. I yawned quite a few times though. It is really long and it would probably be so much more entertaining if it was just 90 minutes but as it is several scenes just drag along not giving the viewer anything no content, no grand acting, no new and brutal visuals(yes, the scenery IS VERY WELL DONE! But it is not so beautiful that I want to stare at it while nothing is happening and also after a while we have seen all the shots so thank you, next.) And about all the genres...it really is not that funny, not that dark, not frightening and not horrific, some drama in it but not done better then in many TV shows in all fairness. I might be unable to understand some of the humour as I do not speak Korean and also I could only find a synchronised version so there could have been some puns that just flew over my head but I doubt that that would have made a change. The acting is not great, the characters are not really likeable and sometimes feel unfinished the story does really not make much sense and the twists and turns are not something incredibly smart or unexpected. I must really say I went in hoping for great entertainment and did not finish it in one sitting but stopped half way in and finished it the next day because I was disappointed and bored and felt like using my time differently. It is simply a film, the message is very simple and while it has some nice shots it is really not a film I would recommend....to anyone really. I even now knowing the film, rereading the reviews do not see what those people saw in it. Which is grand! People have different tastes! As a review in simple terms: A mediocre film, with nothing outstanding about it and ruined by a too long running time which results in the film being boring."

BUT... 90% of the film is simply unpleasant to watch. none of the major characters is likable - much less heroic; no one succeeds or even grows. every character is amoral. one small example out of dozens: a young man going overseas to college gifts our penniless protagonist a job tutoring a wealthy 15-year-old girl in return for the promise to keep her away from dating til the student returns from overseas and the girl turns 18. our hero without a moment of hesitation betrays his friend and starts a romance with his student. i read that ""get out"" originally ended with the hero dying, that jordan peele added the rescue after preliminary focus groups said they hated the movie. parasite feels to me a horror movie like ""get out"" without the redemptive ending. or think ""inglorious basterds"" without the redemptive ending."

I highly recommend you don't spend time and money on it It made me very uncomfortable watching two hours of people scamming other people (and worse) for personal gain. Yes, you see that in movies all the time, but this one simmered in cruelty in slow motion...surrounded by beautiful people and sets. I didn't like ANY of the characters in the movie and that is hard to do I felt a hollow sadness when I left Maybe because it had a lot of ""10's"" or maybe it is a reflection of what society thinks is a good film. The only redeeming quality I saw was that the Korean people are sweeter than us , like 1950's bad guys in suits."

Depressing nihilism. Director/writer clearly has given up all hope of modern civilization ever rising above the swamps of despair and manipulation. That's his right to an opinion, of course, but in this particular film his vision feels simplistic and seems to exist for no other reason than to provoke and wallow."

The people touting it as a 10 are pseudo-intellectuals trying to construct something that just wasn't there - like the amateur critics on here who think of themselves as legit film critics. I'm sorry, the film just doesn't deserve the hype or accolades, and most certainly not the Academy Award (even for foreign language film, let alone Best Film). I was expecting something deeply profound and artistic, and this just wasn't either of those things. This is a horrible example of trying to expand one's cinematic palate to foreign films, because there are wonderful foreign films out there. I'm guessing the people that liked this also thought ""Mother"" was some sort of mind blowing masterpiece."

It starts as predictable slapstick comedy, then takes a sudden turn into a bloodsport parable on class warfare, and then then finishes -- can you guess? -- Nihilistic irony! Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings. Apparently, Korean free enterprise economy makes them this way and their personal aspirations, ambitions, and accomplishments are simply results of circumstance and luck, as the wealthy and the poor are equally dimwitted, amoral, and self-interested."

Like most Oscar movies they are either really good or really bad. In this case the movie was highly overrated. Ignoring the fact nothing that is done in the movie is logical or would actually work in real life, the movie doesn't seem to know what kind of movie it is. If movies have a twist or something you didn't expect, usually you are like ""Oh wow, that was amazing!"". But this left me confused. Alot of what happens makes the movie feel pointless. Obviously this is a spoiler free review, so I'll just say some movies have good guys and bad guys, not sure if the movie makers understood what that means in this. The only reason I gave it two stars was it was South Koreas first movie to get an Oscar."

But best picture overall? No way. It's excruciatingly slow and the story has been done before. It's not particularly funny either (like that other Korean film from a year ago was). I never connected with any of the characters or cared one bit about anyone. Just another example of identity politics and Hollywood giving undeserved awards. How did Joker get overlooked?

If anything, the most likeable people are the wealthy family being taken advantage of. This can be forgiven, movies with bad people as leads can still be good but Parasite is a depressing and often ridiculous ride. There are completely unrealistic twists and turns and the final bloody actions of the main character seem unwarranted and mildly out of character. I left the theater feeling like I had not only wasted time but was put in a bad mood from the overly bleak nature of the film. I know I am in the vast minority here, as every other person I have talked to loved the movie, but to me Parasite was not just unworthy of a Best Picture award but was an terrible movie."

The film did not live up to being a great Korean film, or best anything, and especially not Oscar worthy, where the only thing I enjoyed about this film was that view from their living room because the plot was an insult on a few levels. And I'm not sure if anyone else had the same issues I had with the subtitles being extremely small to the point I was squinting trying to read the lines while watching it on Amazon Fire tv. That was a first for me, nevertheless, I understood enough to know that this movie was highly overrated! What a huge let down, I think I want my 4.99 back."

This movie is one to watch. It seems the Oscar win for best picture was a diversity quota gift. I wouldn't bother with this movie I saw 1917 when comparing it to this it was the deserving winner, but Hollywood is full of politics. This is the reason why ordinary people are losing interest in Hollywood and turning to streaming platforms in droves."

Tries a lot but accomplishes nothing noteworthy. The film is pretentious, just like its critics. People read so much into it that it makes me sick. Everything is superficial, the plot barely makes sense, and there's no real tension. Well, many people seem to like the film, but I'm definitely not one of them. Rarely have I been so disappointed by a film as I was by this one. Even many B-movies are more interesting than this film. I can't help but wonder if some snobs just want to celebrate it because it's Korean-that's trendy right now. It reminds me of modern art: more show than substance. See it for yourselves, but as for me, I definitely won't be watching this film again."

Like some of the rest here, i did not get it. With so much discussed about metaphors and the likes, I am either not good enough to read it or too casual not to over-read/read into somethings that's not there in the first place. The movie tries too hard to be clever and it unfortunately ends up alienating people like me who come in hoping it may draw you in like the Shawshank redemption does. My humble view notwithstanding, my congratulations to the Director for his Oscar win. It's a fabulous nod to Asian Cinema. It doesn't hurt that a ton of people here enjoy it too. That's the beauty of films, some like it some don't."

The last event wasn't too disastrous except Mr. Kim's action. The naivety was tremendous from the housewife and tries too hard to sell. For the acting, it was top notch from everyone involved.

Second, this film isn't particularly educational or anywhere near a real event. Third, this film doesn't even stand out among Korean films, the acting, cinematography, scripts are good but not great.

It involves plotting, scamming, farce, and a series of increasingly bizarre events that eventually spin out of all control, with a macabre twist. If you laugh at people having accidents or enjoy the Japanese game shows where contestants have to eat large maggots or suffer cockroaches crawling all over their faces, then you'll probably enjoy the humour. If you're not on that particular wavelength then you might struggle with some of it. The film won the Palme d'Or at Cannes, but as with Barton Fink - another winner - the award seems increasingly to be a measure of novelty."

After sitting through it, a film that in all honesty made two hours seem like three, then coming onto IMDB to see what others thought, I'm astonished. Let's begin with the positives though - cinematography was good, acting was okay(ish)... and that's about where it ends. The negatives are considerable though: A weak script which often made little sense or logic, more plot holes than Swiss cheese, ridiculous scenarios that defied belief and an ending that completely falls off a cliff edge and leaves the viewer wondering why they wasted two hours on this drivel. In reality I'd probably rate it a 4/10, but as at time of writing Parasite sits at 8.5/10, which is farcical given how weak this film is, I'm giving it a 2 to try and restore a bit of balance and common sense. I am gobsmacked at how many on here are rating this a 10 and can only presume that it's down to a complete lack of quality movie experience or, more likely, that some are so oversaturated in the endless stream of CGI comic book garbage we've all been subjected to over the last decade+ that anything, ANYTHING that strays from the rut immediately garners a flailing of arms and lauding of ""Best film EVER!!!"" Thirty years ago this film would've been where it deserved towards the low end of the barrel, but in today's distinctly subpar cinema offerings it's now being tipped as on Oscar possibilty. Utterly ridiculous. For those of you who are praising this film as the best thing since sliced bread, go and get yourselves a film education. A good place to start is Claude Berri's marvelous 'Jean de Florette' and 'Manon des Sources' to see how it should be done. Films you actually don't want to end, rather than praying for them to finish one hour in."

At first glance, it appears that they are genuinely praising the movie's artistic quality but the truth is, they are merely praising its supposed profound social commentary and propaganda. In a society where people prefer to stay in echo-chambers and repulsing those who don't fit the status quo, it is no surprise that this motion picture is highly acclaimed given that it appeals to the ideologies of Marxist lunatics today by making the audience feel sympathy for the poor characters and contempt for the wealthy ones. The movie doesn't necessarily condone the main characters' actions as it still portrays their crimes in a negative light. But that leads us to another issue; the movie wants us to think that their crimes are the results of ""genius"" planning even though their plans are only made possible because of some stupid plot point that requires us to suspend our disbelief. It just goes to show how much the film is trying to insult the audience's intelligence by thinking they'd buy into it. In summary, the director Bong Joon-Ho seems to believe that class and status indicate one's character, as evident by his attempt at portraying the main characters in a positive light despite them being a bunch of lazy and conniving criminals. Perhaps, the only redeemable quality of this film is its cinematography which admittedly is quite beautiful."

This movie was done *as if* it were a satire, *as if* it were making a statement, *as if* it has a deeper meaning. Instead, it's hollow at its core, mean-spirited, and pointless. It's a film for those like the idea of making a point but not having to suffer any uncomfortable truths. The only good effect of this film is that it exposes the vacuity of those who praise it and their self-delusion. It's a barometer of the public's appetite for garbage. See this film only in the context of a sociology experiment and be shocked at how far we've fallen in our gullibility and how desperate we are not to face ourselves."

The opening of the film, introducing the starving Kim family and their machinations to secure work as the household staff of the Park family. It beautifully demonstrates the life in the city slums, with superbly executed plots to get the Parks' existing staff fired and replaced with the Kims. These plots become progressively more cruel, showing the Kims' slide into villainy. The complication arrives when the former head maid asks the Kims if she can retrieve something from the Park house. Here the Kims truly become villains, manipulating the secrets of the house for their own gain and even turning to overt violence to preserve their position. It is here that the film loses its way. Though certainly the Kims and their rivals have difficult choices to make, they are depicted as being gratuitously cruel. Each faction needs to remove obstacles, of course; each faction shows no restraint, fine. But the film lingers on this wickedness for so long, the audience becomes estranged to all of them. We no longer care about ANY of these characters because they have all become monsters; we abandon watching their fight because we have better things to do with our lives. The failure of this film (as with so many of the last few decades) is in the writing and editing. The sets are beautiful, the camerawork superb. But the film lingers on human suffering purely for the shock factor. The suffering of the Kims is sadly reality for those at the bottom of South Korean society, and desperation makes villains of us all, but this is not a documentary. This is meant to be entertainment, something people can enjoy. Angela's Ashes depicted similar levels of poverty yet still maintained the sympathy of the audience."

No real spoilers below. 2. My wife and I did not like this film at all (but note we also hated Pulp Fiction and Little Miss Sunshine which were also very popular with many people). The cinematography was excellent. Beautifully filmed and showing bits of Sth Korean life that I had never seen. Of course, some aspects, the unemployed family and the wealthy family themselves were probably atypical. We both thought the story and most scenes were quite ""old style"": trite, contrived and quite trivial. The film didn't venture into slapstick thank goodness but the lines and jokes were simple old ones transposed into a modern setting. I chuckled slightly ONCE during the film. Just not my sort of humour (give me ""Kives Out""). In terms of drama it was a bit like watching grass grow, OK interesting grass but that was all. The ending had a strong message but was executed in a completely over the top and ridiculous manner, and out of all context (style-wise) with what preceded. I can understand why a lot of people loved this film, and laughed a lot (although noone else was laughing in the cinema when we viewed the film). It has some strong elements in it but just dragged out too thinly for me. Worth seeing this film just in case it is your thing."

The ending - any half decent detective would have pieced it all together, including the cellar. The invitation - why would any sane house-sitter invite a total stranger into the house?

It makes you feel so depressed that since this is something I do struggle with, it affected my mental health after watching this. The quality was really disappointing, I predicted everything that was going to happen at every point in the story and none of the main characters felt anything approaching realistic as they were extremely one-dimensional and horrible from the opening moments with a completely age-inappropriate relationship involving one of those characters throughout the film.

How do you describe people's action with logic? You dont, cause there is none. If you think there is, think again. You must be thinking in steryotypes if you believe any people in asia would act anything like in the movie."

My honest feeling is that the claim to offer some kind of social commentary is a layer of ""respectability varnish"" that serves as an excuse for filmmaker and viewer to indulge in the heavy-handed violence that tickles their fancy, and nobody wants to admit that because, well, their peers (and colleague critics) like it, so it must be good. But then again, this seems so blindingly obvious that it's hard to believe that so many people fall for it. I'm honestly struggling with this: I think being critical and voicing social commentary is good and necessary, but movies like this feel rather as if it's part of the problem. They're ice-cold, de-humanising, disengaging. They make me care less. But then again, maybe I'm just stupid and blind."

This film has none. And, the reviewers who have rated it so highly can only be suspect for there sense of humanity and value. Beware the Metascore!!!!"

And Parasite is technically not bad at all. However when watching a movie, it is quite rewarding to find some constructive citicism and good morals and principles. Well, in Parasite all you see is a man criticize at the way society works, with its undeniable flaws but, in the most destructive way I have ever seen. As he purposely doesn't leave room for good as he does for evil. As Frank Capra said 90 years ago: ""all cried: Emancipate our films from morality... Kill for thrill-shock! Shock! To hell with the good in man"" That is why to me ""It´s a wonderful life"", ""Up"", ""Lord of the rings"", ""Jojo rabbit"", ""Lemans 66"", ""Ordinary people""... while thay may be technically worse movies than parasite, are a whole universe better than what Bong Joon Ho could ever dream."

The movie deals very unsuccessfully with the topic of social class struggle. Basically, the movie offers a violent tale of resentment and inverse snobbery. The rich are stupid and undeserving, the poor are a brotherhood of crooks, etc. It both denigrates rich and poor at the same time. It criticises capitalism and meritocracy but offers no alternative whatsoever. There is a dangerous apology of social revenge ( in the view of the movie, which sides ideologically with the poor, these are justified to kill the rich). It furthers violence, division and polarisation. Repugnant view of the world. Biased, Immoral, Unreal. Pure unadulterated prejudices. Not surprised that Cannes and Hollywood give it prizes. These awards are clearly political. Cinematic Quality has nothing to do with it. All this hype furthered my opinion about the inherent detestability of this very bad movie. Overrated is an understatement. Sick film, sick story. We live in decadent times. It is obvious."

imdb2941,incomprehensible film acclaimed possibly heading oscar primary flaw subtitles dialog translated poor cousin google translate reviewed speaks english grammar window literal word translations miss meaning subtitles flashed quickly native english speaker time read result subtitle travesty plot hard understand mid movie plot twists plot movie's decidedly unremarkable cinematography excellent actors competent reminiscent jackie chan rating hollywood sophisticates disagree bother watching understand hangul,1,Seriously Flawed,2020-01-20,imdb,"It is incomprehensible to me that this film is acclaimed and possibly heading for an Oscar. The primary flaw are the subtitles. The dialog has been translated by a poor cousin of Google Translate and NEVER reviewed by someone who speaks English. Grammar is out the window. Literal word translations miss the meaning. Subtitles are often flashed up so quickly that a native English speaker doesn't have time to read them. The result of this subtitle travesty is that the plot is very hard to understand, particularly the mid-movie plot twists. The overall plot is clear by the movie's end and decidedly unremarkable. The cinematography is excellent. The actors seem competent but reminiscent of Jackie Chan. Overall rating a one ... of course the Hollywood sophisticates will disagree. Don't bother watching this unless you understand Hangul."

I went in with exceptionally high expectations, given the glowing reviews and high ratings. Having watched it earlier today, I can confidentially say, it was the most disappointing movie I have watched, so much so, I felt the need to write a review. It's a movie that simply doesn't live up to its hype whatsoever. Not only is it a poor representation of the class divide that exists in many parts of the world, portraying a lower class family in a degrading and deceitful way, but most if not every scene that was meant to be suspenseful, was just outright anti climatic, to the point where I was like ""oh... is that it"". To make things worse, the movie was 2 hours long! 2 hours that I will never get back."

I rather liked the first part, but then the film de-generates into what could be ""sick"" territory. The film touches on some important social issues (e.g., class struggle, relations among the various social classes) and has accomplished actors, as well as great cinematography, but that does not in itself make for a great movie. This movie does not succeed as a comedy, drama or horror. The descriptors that come to mind for me are: repugnant, de-generate, immoral (or at least amoral), and having an 'eat the rich"" mentality. Perhaps, you shouldn't pay too much attention to my ramblings, however. The film, after all, is rated well into the 8's and won four Oscars. Makes me think of the Colosseum in Rome, which apparently was quite popular in its day."

Someone gives you jobs for your whole family and you cheat him by all means and hit him at his back to retaliate for no reason? It's just ridiculously dumb and stupid.

The cinematography was wonderful, but once again, my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film. I found the movie sadistic and disturbing. Rather than a provoking statement about class, I saw a dark, sick film laced with contempt, gratuitous violence, caricatures of people, and unlikeable characters with no moral compass. How utterly depressing."

The Parasite that I watched was boring, meaningless, senselessly violent and did not evoke one emotion other than disgust and bewilderment that this movie won Best Picture. There wasn't one character that was even the slightest bit relatable and the plot was absolutely over the top unrealistic. It was a grand gesture for the Academy to award this subtitled, foreign movie, however, receiving an underdog award does not make the movie good.

Add the unnecessary vulgarity and violence and I was sorry I wasted my money. Both families were trash in their own special way. I left feeling pretty dirty by the experience. I'm not naive about human behavior, but in a day where the media pushes divisiveness, I felt like it was driving the wedge deeper by promoting hatred and distrust between the rich and poor. There are solutions to our issues and I wish the media (including ""entertainment"" media) would stop pushing their agenda."

He's like, ""Hey, look, poor people are just freeloaders living off the sweat of the rich!"" It's as if he believes the rich are the hardworking, upstanding citizens while the poor are just leeches. But wait, it gets better! The movie practically screams, ""Rich people are awesome, and they totally earned all their wealth."" Yeah, right! Most of us know it's often about nepotism and inheriting stuff, not blood, sweat, and tears. The director might as well be the president of the Ayn Rand fan club, shouting, ""Greed is good!"" As for the movie itself, forget about comedy or horror-it's just plain bonkers and uncomfortable to watch. Imagine sitting down to watch if you're barely living and making it? If you are a maid? Is this what your boss thinks of you as a maid? It's like the poor cannot be trusted. That's a recipe for some serious awkwardness! And don't even get me started on Cannes. It's like a gathering of eccentric ""artists"" who think they're creating something groundbreaking. But honestly, most of the recent award-winning movies, like this one, are just plain junk. So, if you're looking for a good laugh or a spine-tingling scare, ""Parasite"" might not be your cup of tea. It's more like a cup of confusing, uncomfortable, and downright weird."

In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic.

It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become.

So many accolades and Oscars have been thrown at this movie, and while that's not the main requirement for a great movie, it gives off the impression that there has to be SOME redeeming qualities about it. I was excited to see a foreign-language film win Best Picture and was fully prepared to at least enjoy the movie as a social commentary, as many people lauded it as a powerful work of art and ""masterpiece"" (a word that is used WAY too often these days). So basically, I hated it. I got about an hour and a half into the film before my mom and I decided we had enough and couldn't succumb ourselves to watching the rest of this cartoonish sequence of events, despite the fact that I rented it. I could state a plethora of reasons for despising the film but to summarize my thoughts, I felt that the characters were underdeveloped and acted more like caricatures than real people we encounter, the film's aesthetic was not pleasing for the viewer to watch (and I understand that the movie's uneasiness was the point but I was not a fan of the directing style and the strange shots) and I kept thinking some bizarre creature was gonna come out and fully push this film into fantasy/horror genre. I just really did not like anything about it. I usually always finish movies once I'm dedicated to watching something but this was just impossible. I get some of the messages the director was trying to make but it comes off as a complete joke to me that this film won so many awards, including BEST PICTURE. None of the characters were likable. Absolutely none. I'm not sure if I was supposed to hate the rich family for just being rich and slightly conceited and root for the poor family because of their circumstances, but they didn't seem to have any empathy or compassion for even other working-class people like them in the pursuit to get what they wanted which came off as very cold and sad. I love films that make you question who the protagonists and antagonists are and I know not all movies are meant to be uplifting, but these characters were lazily written and we don't get any insight into their inner monologue and feelings. The acting was very mediocre for the most part too and sometimes downright cringe-worthy. I truly don't know what I missed but this was just not my cup of tea (or my mom's) and it felt unnecessarily gruesome and strange rather than masterful and sharp."

They take you out of your comfort zone, full of surprises, and have a totally new slant on the art of film making. Well, unfortunately Parasite is none of these things. There are very few films I have actually walked out of the cinema before the end out of pure boredom. Sherlock Holmes with Robert Downey Junior was a notable 'lowlight' (truly truly awful!). Well Parasite has just joined this illustrious group. I'm not going to criticise or question the sanity of people who say this is a masterpiece. That's up to them. But I genuinely just don't get it. Awful acting, boring dialogue, no direction...this film has no redeeming feature in my 'humble opinion'. Hence the title of this review - this film isn't average...it's way, way worse than that. But go see it yourself - you may love it.. Just don't try to convince me that this is anything more than a total snore-fest."
imdb2997,aunts love movie figure technically movies character makes sense,1,leaves me with just hollow emptiness,2020-01-23,imdb,"Everybody and his aunts seem to love this movie - and I can't figure out why. Yes, it's technically well done but so what, many movies are well done. There is not on character of interest to me and nothing makes sense to me."
